22
00:02:21,620 --> 00:02:24,640
I can imagine you singing on Eurostar one day.

23
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:29,610
All those screaming girls wishing you could sing just for them.

24
00:02:31,660 --> 00:02:33,820
You have such a beautiful voice.

25
00:02:33,820 --> 00:02:35,650
You can't keep it a secret.

26
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,970
Why not? You keep secrets.

27
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:40,850
I do?

28
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:45,570
You said I couldn't talk about the doctor we went to.

29
00:02:47,450 --> 00:02:48,990
That's true.

30
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,850
You mustn't.

31
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:52,680
Especially to your father.

32
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,940
It's our secret, okay?

33
00:02:55,190 --> 00:02:57,210
Please. Okay.

34
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:40,740
Stop teaching my son to sing like a fucking queer.

35
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:43,080
Anton, it's for school.

36
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:46,240
Nobody tells me how to raise my son.

37
00:03:48,170 --> 00:03:50,530
- Don't touch her! - You love your mother, huh?

38
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:52,550
You love her more than your father?

39
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,390
You won't love her so much...

40
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,930
when you know our little secret.

41
00:03:59,350 --> 00:04:00,700
You're drunk.

42
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:03,240
You want to know who your mama is, huh?

43
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,860
- Mama's boy? - Stop it!

44
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:07,160
Stop it!

45
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,070
That's my boy!

46
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:15,890
I knew there was a man in there. A man like me.

47
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:20,260
I know what I am.

48
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:23,530
And I know what that makes you.

49
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,410
And this cunt, she's more than your mother.

50
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,140
No!

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,030
We have to go.

52
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:58,160
He'll find us.

53
00:04:58,950 --> 00:04:59,920
I'm going to fix--

54
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,160
Fix it.

55
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,700
This time, he's not coming after us.

56
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,100
We're getting out of here.

57
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:19,930
Wolfgang... it's not worth it.

58
00:05:23,450 --> 00:05:25,090
I'm not worth it.

59
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,240
Wolfgang.

60
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:34,710
Can you hear me?

61
00:05:35,950 --> 00:05:37,400
Can you hear me?

62
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:41,490
Wolfgang.

63
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:43,660
Can you hear me?

64
00:05:48,070 --> 00:05:49,550
Thank God.

65
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,800
Oh, thank God.

66
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,930
Don't say anything. They're monitoring everything. Okay?

67
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:02,560
Just follow me. Follow my voice.

68
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,340
I have you. I have you.

69
00:06:09,640 --> 00:06:11,490
Do you know we have Whispers?

70
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,040
We're going to use him to get you free. Okay?

71
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,600
Don't.

72
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,890
What?

73
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:22,840
Because I'm-- I'm not worth it.

74
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:25,040
Wolfgang, you are.

75
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:28,000
You are.

76
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,780
I know what love is because of you.

77
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:35,360
I love you, Wolfgang.

78
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,570
And I swear we're going to get you free.

79
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,600
What happened? Was that Wolfgang?

80
00:06:56,830 --> 00:06:58,780
They have him on sedatives and on blockers

81
00:06:58,780 --> 00:07:01,310
so it was difficult to connect,

82
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:03,400
but at least they aren't hurting him anymore.

83
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,840
That's good.

84
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:09,860
Will said they wouldn't as long as we have Whispers.

85
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:15,090
I don't know how much longer I can wait until the exchange.

86
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:16,430
I know.

87
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,960
It'll be soon.

88
00:07:19,820 --> 00:07:22,290
But right now, we need more of the liquid blocker.

89
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:24,720
Yes, of course.

90
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,420
I'm running low on methatactogen trioxide.

91
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:30,570
Nomi will have to forge another prescription.

92
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,250
Already on it.

93
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,880
It's cooked.

94
00:07:40,850 --> 00:07:42,550
This should last us through the week.

95
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:44,900
I don't think we have a week. We have to go soon.

96
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,150
How was the d'Orsay?

97
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:47,990
Sadly, it didn't work out.

98
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:53,330
- So right now, Will is talking to Riley? - And with Sun, Kala.

99
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,900
Our exchange plan is based on finding the right location

100
00:07:55,900 --> 00:07:57,490
and disguisable transportation,

101
00:07:57,490 --> 00:07:59,530
and right now we have neither.

102
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:01,570
Yeah, we go check it out!

103
00:08:02,350 --> 00:08:02,930
And now Capheus.

104
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:05,630
Capheus? But I thought he was trying to buy a police van?

105
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:07,830
Guess what I found?

106
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,140
The van that should work.

107
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,210
Great.

108
00:08:14,210 --> 00:08:15,600
A little paint.

109
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:18,350
It'll be perfect.

110
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:20,670
Okay.

111
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,800
It's a start.

112
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,240
Will, what just happened?

113
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,850
Capheus found a van.

114
00:08:27,970 --> 00:08:30,750
So, Will just saw through Capheus' eyes?

115
00:08:31,180 --> 00:08:33,130
Sort of. It feels more like you're there

116
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:34,660
than you're looking through their eyes.

117
00:08:34,660 --> 00:08:35,570
That is so freaking cool!

118
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,850
I don't know if I'll get over it. It's mind-blowing.

119
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:42,360
I can feel my ideas of self... expanding.

120
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,860
Sometimes it's not great.

121
00:08:43,860 --> 00:08:47,240
You know we can hear you... even when you lower your voice.

122
00:08:47,240 --> 00:08:49,000
I didn't mean anything.

123
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:51,150
- Who's that? - It's Nomi.

124
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:55,450
Maybe Sans Jour is the best option?

125
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:56,870
People know you've played there.

126
00:08:56,870 --> 00:08:59,080
They might be expecting it after Amsterdam,

127
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:02,060
but we are running out of options.

128
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,490
I need Whisper's shot.

129
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,900
Kala.

130
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,010
It's ready.

131
00:09:14,350 --> 00:09:15,700
And...

132
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:17,480
I'm on my way.

133
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,090
Wait for me.

134
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:25,290
Is there anything else on Jonas' phone?

135
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:26,990
Nothing. The only calls he made

136
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,710
were to the Secretary, Peapod, and Just Eat.

137
00:09:29,710 --> 00:09:31,350
We need more on the Secretary.

139
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:33,330
Right now, he's our only direct line to the Chairman.

140
00:09:33,330 --> 00:09:34,970
If we had better equipment...

141
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:36,590
Still no word from Bug?

142
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:39,770
No, but you know that's Bug.

143
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:45,800
Actually, it isn't like Bug at all,

144
00:09:45,990 --> 00:09:47,440
but I don't want Neets to know

145
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,880
that I am completely freaking out about it.

146
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,730
BPO doesn't know he exists.

147
00:09:51,730 --> 00:09:54,200
Diego couldn't find the official documents on him anywhere.

148
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,380
He's like a character from one of my movies.

149
00:09:56,450 --> 00:09:57,860
No, he's better.

150
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:00,000
Because he's real.

151
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:02,660
We have to stay focused.

152
00:10:02,830 --> 00:10:05,400
We know BPO's going to do everything they can to stop us,

153
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:07,400
but as long as we stick to our plan--

154
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:09,770
Holy shit! Now this is something.

155
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,440
- What? - Elizabeth.

156
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,560
- Who's Elizabeth? - Whisper's wife.

157
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:16,260
I thought BPO moved her and their daughter to a safe house?

158
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:17,710
There's no address listed.

159
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:20,710
But it is good to know that even people under BPO's protection

160
00:10:20,710 --> 00:10:22,760
follow the same rules as the rest of us.

161
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,790
When they file for divorce.

162
00:10:33,180 --> 00:10:37,050
Morning, Milt. On the stool.

163
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,560
Look at my wall.

164
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,510
How are you doing today?

165
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,820
I know you don't want to answer my questions.

166
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,240
You don't have to.

167
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:03,140
Jonas pretty much told me everything I need to know.

168
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:10,390
Yeah, we were just talking about you and your wife...

169
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,060
Elizabeth.

170
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:16,310
And Jonas really seemed to think that she loves you, but...

171
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:18,460
I don't know.

172
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:30,380
We were also talking about... your daughter.

173
00:11:32,150 --> 00:11:33,680
What was her name?

174
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:40,590
Do you miss her?

175
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:43,620
A typical father would, but...

176
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:46,790
you're not typical, are you?

177
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,750
See, I figure when someone cuts open the skull

178
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:56,510
of a young girl like Sara Patrell while she's still alive...

179
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:00,770
they can't possibly look at another little girl

180
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,600
and not think about that.

181
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,520
Maybe you can.

182
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:11,460
As a boy, I was an exceptional student.

183
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,710
I loved reading.

184
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:21,100
I opened a book and found secrets and knowledge hidden inside.

185
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:24,360
When I was a medical student,

186
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,720
I learned how to operate on human beings.

187
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:32,130
I imagined they had names and lives,

188
00:12:32,310 --> 00:12:34,630
but as far as I was concerned,

189
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:37,460
they were the same as books...

190
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:41,290
except I opened them with my knife.

191
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,760
Every moment I remain here brings me closer to the moment

192
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:51,620
I will open Ms. Gunnarsdottir while she is still alive

193
00:12:51,910 --> 00:12:57,570
so that you can feel as I slice into her cerebellum...

194
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:03,480
and cut after cut, her secrets and knowledge

195
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,050
will spill across my table.

196
00:13:11,530 --> 00:13:15,820
When all that remains of her and you and your cluster...

197
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:19,840
are the measurements and observations in my notebook,

198
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,200
I will go home...

199
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:26,520
and I will kiss my beautiful wife and my daughter...

200
00:13:27,630 --> 00:13:30,880
and I will return to my exceptional life.

201
00:13:33,990 --> 00:13:36,650
I wouldn't be so sure about that, Milt.

202
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:40,100
That beautiful wife of yours?

203
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:44,680
She just filed for divorce.

204
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,040
There's no going back.

205
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,880
Not for you,

206
00:13:54,350 --> 00:13:55,690
not for me...

207
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,540
not for any of us.

209
00:14:05,900 --> 00:14:07,670
That time again, Jonas.

210
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,930
"The bonds that bind another person

211
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:14,410
to ourself exist only in our mind."

212
00:14:16,270 --> 00:14:18,940
I wonder if Monsieur Proust was a sensate.

213
00:14:18,940 --> 00:14:21,740
I doubt he was ever handcuffed to a radiator.

214
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,850
Here you go.

215
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:33,170
I must compliment you on these blockers.

216
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,180
Really top-shelf stuff.

217
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,890
None of the nausea you get with regular homemade.

218
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,310
Thank you.

219
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,580
Still don't trust me?

220
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:49,780
Give us a reason to trust you. Tell us about the Chairman.

221
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:52,070
Now that sounds like Will talking.

222
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,700
If he was using you as a watchdog...

223
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,000
You must have talked to him.

224
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:59,790
I explained he uses a voice modulator. He wears a bio-mask.

225
00:14:59,790 --> 00:15:01,410
He's quite a paranoid fellow.

226
00:15:01,500 --> 00:15:02,750
- So you say. - So you say.

227
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:05,290
- Thing is, we want to trust you, Jonas. - You helped us once.

228
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,350
What we can't figure out is why you stopped.

229
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,720
It seems we keep returning

230
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,980
to that moment you and I first met, Will,

231
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:12,720
in the convenience store.

232
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,220
I asked you to choose between what you heard and what you felt.

233
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:19,980
You told me the choice you made was a mistake.

234
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:22,640
No, the mistake is thinking we're back in the same place.

235
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,500
We're not.

236
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:27,250
You're a prisoner handcuffed to a radiator.

237
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,250
So I am.

238
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:31,580
Let's talk about Angelica.

239
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:34,660
I'm trying to understand her decision to go to Chicago.

240
00:15:34,670 --> 00:15:37,070
She was there looking for her first cluster.

241
00:15:37,560 --> 00:15:40,800
And then she starts working with Kolovi and Whispers.

242
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,300
And this is the part that bothers me.

243
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,820
She helped build a machine

244
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:48,360
that uses lobotomized sensates to murder people.

245
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,690
That does not sound like the Angelica

246
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:51,540
you described in the train station.

247
00:15:52,670 --> 00:15:53,920
In the ninth century,

248
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:57,920
Chinese alchemists were searching for an elixir to prolong life.

249
00:15:59,220 --> 00:16:03,360
They combined saltpeter, sulfur, and charcoal...

250
00:16:04,230 --> 00:16:06,040
and gave the world gunpowder.

251
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:08,970
Come on, Jonas, stop bullshitting.

252
00:16:18,770 --> 00:16:20,280
Angelica.

253
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:28,490
There is no one in the world I have known better.

254
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:33,790
But I never could have imagined

255
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,530
what she would do during her brief life.

256
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:51,300
She left the cabin because she loved Raoul,

257
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:54,880
and somehow she could feel he was alive in Chicago.

258
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:57,040
Once she was there...

259
00:16:57,670 --> 00:17:01,030
she wanted to understand what Kolovi and Whispers were doing.

260
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:03,140
She needed them to trust her.

261
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,570
Very soon, she realized she could use their technology

262
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:22,120
to build a machine to trace

263
00:17:22,120 --> 00:17:24,720
her psycellium connection to her children.

264
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,050
She worked secretly,

265
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:28,800
developing a graft of neural-morphic ligature

266
00:17:28,800 --> 00:17:32,620
and using the conductivity of psycellium to send a signal.

267
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:37,120
Imagine a sonar that emits not sound...

268
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:40,320
but pain.

269
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,380
Pain, Will.

270
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,220
Pain connects us.

271
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,350
Pain binds us better to one another than anything else.

272
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:16,060
Oh, my baby. I'm so...

273
00:18:19,260 --> 00:18:20,620
Milton.

274
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:24,680
I--

275
00:18:25,910 --> 00:18:28,140
I thought that you were going to laugh at me.

276
00:18:28,150 --> 00:18:32,300
I just... didn't really want to show you until I was certain,

277
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:36,110
but now I am, I...

278
00:18:36,280 --> 00:18:38,600
Look. It's a breakthrough.

279
00:18:38,840 --> 00:18:41,020
I just followed your research.

280
00:18:44,060 --> 00:18:45,690
Extraordinary.

281
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,400
Extraordinary.

282
00:18:54,410 --> 00:18:57,350
A Chicago cop can understand that life doesn't always allow us

283
00:18:57,350 --> 00:18:59,610
to be the best version of ourselves.

284
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:03,190
Particularly when circumstances demand

285
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:05,450
we lie and betray our friends...

286
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:10,110
or compels us to handcuff an ally to a radiator.

287
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,050
Neets?

288
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:33,280
There you are.

289
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,550
I couldn't sleep.

290
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,530
Are you okay?

291
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:54,190
Sometimes all this... it's hard.

292
00:19:55,220 --> 00:19:57,470
I mean, we're in Paris, Nom.

293
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:00,340
That's the Eiffel Tower.

294
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:04,520
When I was in college,

295
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,640
all I thought about was coming to this city.

296
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,930
I was gonna live in an attic apartment

297
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:13,160
and work at Shakespeare and Co. while I wrote my novel.

298
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,620
I had fantasies about falling in love

299
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,700
with a tragically detached French girl

300
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:22,070
that I would finally break through to

301
00:20:22,120 --> 00:20:24,850
when I kissed her in front of the tourists up there...

302
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,910
at the top of the Eiffel Tower.

303
00:20:29,670 --> 00:20:32,430
You never told me any of that.

304
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:35,210
You had your past lives. I had mine too.

305
00:20:36,170 --> 00:20:40,110
I got through some very tough times thinking about this city.

306
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:43,960
And now that I'm actually here

307
00:20:44,470 --> 00:20:46,480
with the woman I love...

308
00:20:47,470 --> 00:20:50,990
And the Eiffel Tower is right there, but we can't enjoy it

309
00:20:50,990 --> 00:20:54,030
because at any moment something terrible could happen.

310
00:20:58,250 --> 00:21:01,390
Listen to me, Amanita Caplan.

311
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:05,490
When I put this ring on your finger, I made you a promise,

312
00:21:05,510 --> 00:21:08,300
and I am going to keep that promise.

313
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,150
I'm going to marry you.

314
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:16,090
I can't believe in a future where that doesn't happen,

315
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:20,070
because a future where we can't enjoy the Eiffel Tower

316
00:21:20,070 --> 00:21:25,000
and kiss in front of the tourists... is no future at all.

317
00:21:25,270 --> 00:21:28,640
And as impossible as that future might seem right now,

318
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:33,470
I will remind you, as you reminded me,

319
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:39,510
impossibility is still just a kiss away from reality.

320
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:50,120
I love you.

321
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,590
I love you.

322
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,490
Again?

323
00:22:10,420 --> 00:22:11,850
Actors.

324
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,930
Look, what I'm trying to explain is that...

325
00:22:15,810 --> 00:22:19,310
this is an important part of his process.

326
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,090
Oh, he will be there.

327
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,690
You have a signal?

328
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:36,210
Dani, what did he say? What did he say?

329
00:22:36,210 --> 00:22:39,920
What? Am I fired? Am I fired? Fired?

330
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:46,830
Is that better?

331
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,500
Yes. I can see you.

332
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:50,010
I can see you too.

333
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,140
Even pixilated, you are beautiful.

334
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,960
We've all been so worried.

335
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:59,520
You should be worried. I am driving the Van Damn.

336
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,140
- The rally worked. - Yes.

337
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:05,180
The poll numbers are rising, but the people need to see you.

338
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,160
Mandiba is asking,

339
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:08,600
"Who is this champion? Why is he hiding?"

340
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,650
Look, I promise. I will explain everything soon.

341
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:15,990
This is a problem, okay? This is a huge problem.

342
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:17,830
BPO contacted my family.

343
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,670
My father left a very cryptic,

344
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:21,650
confusing e-mail as if everything was all right,

345
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:24,170
which my father would never, given these circumstances.

346
00:23:24,170 --> 00:23:25,220
We knew this could happen.

347
00:23:25,220 --> 00:23:27,300
Nomi can check if it's serious.

348
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,620
Nomi's not doing anything

349
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:32,420
until Nomi has a fucking cup of coffee.

350
00:23:32,710 --> 00:23:34,800
No, no, no. No, no, no, no, no.

351
00:23:34,800 --> 00:23:37,870
I can't believe this is happening to us.

352
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:39,580
Why me? What's going on?

353
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:41,770
You're supposed to be running a huge election!

354
00:23:41,770 --> 00:23:43,170
You're supposed to get married.

355
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:46,650
I have the biggest break of my life,

356
00:23:46,650 --> 00:23:48,420
but we're trapped here!

357
00:23:48,540 --> 00:23:50,090
Trapped! We're trapped here!

358
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,300
- Trapped! - Everybody freeze!

359
00:23:54,180 --> 00:23:56,220
Okay, we all need to take a deep breath.

360
00:24:07,110 --> 00:24:08,560
Okay.

361
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,910
I know we're all trying

362
00:24:10,910 --> 00:24:13,780
to hold onto things that matter to us, but...

363
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,620
Wolfgang needs us.

364
00:24:19,100 --> 00:24:20,640
And this is war.

365
00:24:36,260 --> 00:24:37,680
Stop it!

366
00:25:30,790 --> 00:25:32,630
You love your mother?

367
00:25:32,850 --> 00:25:34,750
You love her more than your father?

368
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:41,800
You want to know who your mama is, huh? Mama's boy?

369
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:43,280
Stop it!

370
00:25:44,420 --> 00:25:46,900
When you know our little secret...

371
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:48,990
Why Wolfgang?

372
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,460
Why?

373
00:25:51,900 --> 00:25:53,950
You know our little secret...

374
00:25:54,700 --> 00:25:56,410
You always knew.

375
00:25:56,820 --> 00:25:59,200
But still, you did nothing.

376
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,690
My father... was a monster.

377
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:11,940
And so are you.

378
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:15,480
This cunt. She's more than your mother.

379
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:17,070
She...

380
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:19,110
She's your sister!

381
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:56,800
He married my mother.

382
00:27:00,740 --> 00:27:04,630
She thought he was going to protect us.

383
00:27:06,990 --> 00:27:10,240
One day, he came into my room...

384
00:27:18,120 --> 00:27:20,540
I tried to run away.

385
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,150
He found me.

386
00:27:24,770 --> 00:27:26,620
He always found me.

387
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:29,820
We have to go.

388
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,720
He'll find us.

389
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,610
I'm going to fix it.

390
00:27:33,610 --> 00:27:35,560
I'll get you out of here.

391
00:27:48,910 --> 00:27:51,670
How can a child be this brave?

392
00:27:55,830 --> 00:27:59,670
Wolfgang, it's not worth it.

393
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:02,630
I'm not worth it.

394
00:28:03,260 --> 00:28:05,120
Yes, you are.

395
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:10,340
You are my mom.

396
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:53,190
Don't shoot! We need him alive!

397
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:54,540
Move, move.

398
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:27,450
What is the point of this, Mr. Bogdanow?

399
00:30:28,730 --> 00:30:31,370
We have arranged an exchange with your cluster.

400
00:30:33,770 --> 00:30:36,830
There's nowhere to go from here except home.

401
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,570
I have no home.

402
00:30:41,250 --> 00:30:42,260
No!

403
00:30:45,550 --> 00:30:47,490
You can't do this.

404
00:30:48,910 --> 00:30:50,820
One bullet ends all this shit.

405
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,990
Me and Whispers.

406
00:30:55,180 --> 00:30:56,200
And me.

407
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:01,100
No!

408
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:02,360
No!

409
00:31:10,510 --> 00:31:12,060
You can't give up.

410
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,130
Not you.

411
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,690
Not now.

412
00:31:23,220 --> 00:31:24,510
We knew they wanted Whispers back,

413
00:31:24,510 --> 00:31:26,700
but last night proved just how badly they need him.

414
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:29,660
If I were to guess, I'd say the zombie program--

415
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,890
Has just one pilot.

416
00:31:31,890 --> 00:31:32,960
Whispers.

417
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:36,240
But from what we know, something does not add up.

418
00:31:36,250 --> 00:31:40,060
If I were an evil chairman offering an assassin-for-hire program,

419
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,410
I'd want more than one pilot.

420
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,790
You'd want a bunch of them.

421
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,440
And you'd want more than one neural interface thingy.

422
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:47,850
You'd want enough so that losing one wouldn't matter.

423
00:31:47,850 --> 00:31:48,870
Exactly.

424
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:56,830
Dani.

425
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:04,780
You can leave it there, thank you.

426
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,790
Someone has to sign for it.

427
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:09,030
Bug?

428
00:32:12,450 --> 00:32:13,580
Angels!

429
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:15,930
Are we happy to see you!

430
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:17,390
Oh, my!

431
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:22,820
- You've multiplied. - Yeah.

432
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:24,420
Are these all the voices?

433
00:32:25,030 --> 00:32:25,970
Yeah.

434
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:28,990
What's up, Born Free?

435
00:32:30,190 --> 00:32:32,250
And you know Lito.

436
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:33,680
We met in the Castro.

437
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:35,630
You remembered.

438
00:32:38,710 --> 00:32:41,730
We were worried sick about you.

439
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:43,440
Sorry.

440
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:47,010
Typhoon over Bangkok held me up.

441
00:32:47,170 --> 00:32:50,180
You flew to Paris from San Francisco via Thailand?

442
00:32:51,260 --> 00:32:54,630
You warned me, so I was vigilant.

443
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,760
Took the long way around.

444
00:32:57,230 --> 00:32:58,550
Then I had to chase down some

445
00:32:58,550 --> 00:33:03,820
equipment via a rendez-vous avec Madame Virtuelle.

446
00:33:03,970 --> 00:33:05,720
You speak French as well?

447
00:33:12,870 --> 00:33:15,240
Last time, the language of love was Spanish.

448
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,440
Where's Sun?

449
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,360
There's a report from Seoul.

450
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:28,190
Just when the Bak Investments story

452
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,280
could not get anymore like a Hollywood movie,

453
00:33:30,280 --> 00:33:34,120
Minister Tae Park has been arrested for obstruction of justice.

454
00:33:34,130 --> 00:33:37,720
Tae was under investigation for his ties to Joong-Ki Bak...

455
00:33:37,720 --> 00:33:39,490
I hate that guy.

456
00:33:40,950 --> 00:33:45,710
But I'm kind of glad you didn't stick that rebar through him.

457
00:33:46,690 --> 00:33:47,530
...and the shooting of police

459
00:33:47,530 --> 00:33:50,640
detective Mun during the Bak Gala three weeks ago.

460
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:51,980
Detective Mun is said to

461
00:33:51,980 --> 00:33:54,230
be making a full recovery from his injury.

462
00:33:54,230 --> 00:33:56,950
Many in the media are calling the Bak Investments scandal

463
00:33:56,950 --> 00:33:59,190
the story of the decade.

464
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:03,580
You could call him.

465
00:34:03,590 --> 00:34:07,750
Bug brought a whole box of fresh burners.

466
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:20,230
Shit.

467
00:34:30,810 --> 00:34:32,360
Hello, Detective.

468
00:34:33,550 --> 00:34:34,650
Remember me?

469
00:34:36,620 --> 00:34:37,820
Yeah, I think so.

470
00:34:38,940 --> 00:34:42,110
You look a lot like this woman who kicked my ass a couple times.

471
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,290
I was trying to get her to trust me

472
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,780
when I got shot arresting her scumbag brother.

473
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:49,960
Thank you.

474
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:54,130
I think those two words might have made getting shot worth it.

475
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,410
How are you?

476
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:57,990
Good.

477
00:34:58,770 --> 00:34:59,690
See?

478
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,520
Already back to work.

479
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:04,530
You?

480
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,520
Good.

481
00:35:07,770 --> 00:35:08,760
Where are you?

482
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:10,460
I'm here.

483
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,740
That's all you need to know.

484
00:35:13,370 --> 00:35:14,570
You're not here.

485
00:35:16,510 --> 00:35:17,770
I wish you were.

486
00:35:20,310 --> 00:35:22,710
Are you saying you miss me, Detective Mun?

487
00:35:24,070 --> 00:35:27,500
As a matter of fact, Ms. Bak, that's exactly what I am saying.

488
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:30,340
Say it again.

489
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:32,080
Say what?

490
00:35:34,030 --> 00:35:35,230
Say it.

491
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,740
I miss you like I've never missed anyone in my life.

492
00:35:44,690 --> 00:35:45,640
Now you.

493
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,620
I miss you.

494
00:35:55,010 --> 00:35:56,140
One more time.

495
00:35:57,760 --> 00:36:00,510
- I have to go. - Ms. Bak. Ms. Bak?

496
00:36:00,510 --> 00:36:01,520
I can't.

497
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:13,930
I've been staring at this

498
00:36:13,930 --> 00:36:17,160
screen so long even my glasses are sore.

499
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,660
Tell me about it.

500
00:36:18,660 --> 00:36:21,100
- Well, we're getting close. - We are?

501
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,650
After Raoul died in the cabin,

502
00:36:22,650 --> 00:36:24,550
Angelica and Whispers developed the Traceworks

503
00:36:24,550 --> 00:36:26,600
into what is now the drone program.

504
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:29,070
Sometime around here, they went to London together

505
00:36:29,070 --> 00:36:32,540
just as Croome cut short his holiday in Zurich.

506
00:36:32,550 --> 00:36:35,020
Now I'm guessing this was when Whispers demonstrated

507
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,430
the viability of drone technology

508
00:36:36,430 --> 00:36:39,780
to the people inside BPO, including the Chairman.

509
00:36:39,780 --> 00:36:42,700
But something happened, something Jonas won't talk about,

510
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:43,740
and we know that it's serious

511
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:45,820
because immediately after that trip,

512
00:36:45,830 --> 00:36:48,500
the first terrorist warrants for Jonas were issued.

513
00:36:50,560 --> 00:36:52,190
How does he do that?

514
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:56,040
Guys, have you seen Hernando and Dani?

515
00:36:56,040 --> 00:36:58,730
They went with Amanita for croissants.

516
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,730
Croissants?

517
00:37:00,370 --> 00:37:01,840
No. I need protein.

518
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:04,530
No sugar, no starch. No more carbs in the house, please.

519
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:07,300
No more carbs in the house! I'll eat them all!

520
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:08,610
Oh, my God.

521
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Will, I am staying calm. I am definitely not panicking,

522
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:16,670
but I have just received a very, very worrying e-mail.

523
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:44,160
Rajan!

524
00:37:44,550 --> 00:37:46,200
What are you doing here?

525
00:37:46,200 --> 00:37:47,170
Oh, my God.

526
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,750
Rajan! What are you doing here?

527
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:54,830
My love! I had not heard from you.

528
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:57,480
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

529
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,550
I sent an e-mail.

530
00:37:58,550 --> 00:37:59,800
I was worried!

531
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:03,810
These people came asking for you from some medical organization.

532
00:38:04,530 --> 00:38:06,380
What organization?

533
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:10,610
But the name, I just remember three letters. BP--

534
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:12,130
Oh, shit!

535
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:13,500
Everybody move!

536
00:38:16,410 --> 00:38:18,890
Grab your bag. Come on. Quick.

537
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:21,200
Come on.

538
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:22,260
Come on!

539
00:38:27,030 --> 00:38:29,070
Time for one of those hard decisions, Jonas.

540
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:31,220
Go! Go! Go! Go!

541
00:38:47,490 --> 00:38:48,440
Kala.

542
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:51,990
Who are these people? Have you joined some insane cult?

543
00:38:51,990 --> 00:38:53,270
Rajan, if I'm caught by those men back there,

544
00:38:53,270 --> 00:38:55,370
they will kill me. Come on.

545
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:06,560
I don't know about you, I am not good with heights.

546
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,950
Kind of glad we didn't have breakfast yet.

547
00:39:10,370 --> 00:39:11,340
Croissants!

548
00:39:13,320 --> 00:39:16,270
Wha-- Did I leave the door open?

549
00:39:16,270 --> 00:39:18,520
Hernando. Dani.

550
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:22,790
Freeze! Hands in the air!

551
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,900
Oh, shit!

552
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:27,160
Shit? What shit?

553
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:30,110
- Nomi! - Amanita's in trouble.

554
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:34,050
Family, we're coming!

555
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,000
Nomi!

556
00:39:36,980 --> 00:39:38,160
Jonas!

557
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:43,330
Jonas!

558
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:45,300
I'm on your side.

559
00:39:48,810 --> 00:39:49,720
Fuck!

560
00:39:50,330 --> 00:39:51,420
Amanita!

561
00:39:52,830 --> 00:39:54,380
Get down! Freeze!

562
00:39:54,390 --> 00:39:55,470
Freeze!

563
00:39:55,960 --> 00:39:56,950
Freeze.

564
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:02,860
Freeze! Knees on the floor.

565
00:40:02,870 --> 00:40:03,860
Don't shoot.

566
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:14,510
- Are you okay? - Yeah.

567
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,600
Nom!

568
00:40:28,690 --> 00:40:32,370
Hot damn! I have been waiting to see that!

569
00:40:35,430 --> 00:40:37,680
Are you okay? I thought we lost you.

570
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:39,770
Shit!

571
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:41,220
We should secure these men,

572
00:40:41,220 --> 00:40:43,770
clear anything we need, and get back to the squat.

573
00:40:48,740 --> 00:40:50,730
I'm not going anywhere until someone tells me

574
00:40:50,730 --> 00:40:52,640
just what in the hell is going on here!

575
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:22,070
Come with me.

576
00:41:33,310 --> 00:41:35,490
I'm not sure what I am supposed to say

577
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,720
if what I've just heard is true.

578
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:40,740
Rajan, I know it's not an easy thing, okay?

579
00:41:40,740 --> 00:41:43,580
It took me a long time myself to accept that--

580
00:41:43,630 --> 00:41:49,380
That you are... A different type of human being to me.

581
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:50,610
Yes.

582
00:41:51,140 --> 00:41:54,680
That you are telepathically connected to seven other people.

583
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,880
Telepathy's not exactly...

584
00:41:58,670 --> 00:42:00,320
But basically, yes.

585
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:07,780
And here I thought I was the one with the big secrets.

586
00:42:08,470 --> 00:42:10,110
I didn't know how to tell you.

587
00:42:11,170 --> 00:42:12,320
Or anyone.

588
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:17,870
And this was all happening to you before our wedding?

589
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:20,090
Yes.

590
00:42:21,830 --> 00:42:24,170
Little wonder you were so confused.

591
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:26,680
Yes.

592
00:42:27,970 --> 00:42:31,040
And in... Positano?

593
00:42:32,570 --> 00:42:33,520
Yes!

594
00:42:36,670 --> 00:42:41,010
So, when this Wolfgang fellow is tortured,

595
00:42:41,010 --> 00:42:43,400
you experience his pain?

596
00:42:46,990 --> 00:42:48,410
That sounds terrible.

597
00:42:54,790 --> 00:42:55,680
Look...

598
00:42:56,430 --> 00:42:58,240
I know this is all a shock

599
00:42:58,240 --> 00:43:00,830
and that it might be best for you

600
00:43:00,830 --> 00:43:03,130
to take some time away and just--

601
00:43:03,130 --> 00:43:04,850
But you are in danger now, Kala.

602
00:43:06,440 --> 00:43:08,460
So you believe me?

603
00:43:09,560 --> 00:43:13,870
Would you, could you concoct a lie of this extraordinary magnitude?

604
00:43:14,730 --> 00:43:15,600
No.

605
00:43:16,520 --> 00:43:20,410
Are you and all of these people out there medically insane?

606
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,110
I don't think so.

607
00:43:22,110 --> 00:43:23,740
So what other choice do I have?

608
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:31,750
I came rushing to Paris for the same reason I married you.

609
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,490
I love you, Kala.

610
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:37,640
And that feeling hasn't gone away or been changed

611
00:43:37,910 --> 00:43:40,330
by learning that the woman I love...

612
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:44,410
is so much more than the woman I married.

613
00:43:45,470 --> 00:43:49,130
My God, Rajan.

614
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:53,400
I married a good man.

616
00:44:13,610 --> 00:44:15,770
Sans Jour is down there, next to the river.

617
00:44:15,960 --> 00:44:18,080
It's close to the metro. That's good for us.

618
00:44:18,270 --> 00:44:20,320
Georges said there's a back entrance we could use

619
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,410
and they could bring in extra security.

620
00:44:22,420 --> 00:44:24,660
These club owners are really into you, aren't they?

621
00:44:31,170 --> 00:44:33,530
Oh, how I've missed you.

622
00:44:36,100 --> 00:44:37,880
As beautiful as ever.

623
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,530
This is Will,

624
00:44:46,670 --> 00:44:48,390
the one I told you about.

625
00:44:49,850 --> 00:44:52,670
My rival. Very well.

626
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:54,500
Shall we say pistols at dawn?

627
00:44:56,210 --> 00:44:58,190
English only, I imagine.

628
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:00,680
French if you prefer.

629
00:45:00,680 --> 00:45:04,440
And pistols suit me just fucking fine.

630
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:07,040
I like him already.

631
00:45:07,490 --> 00:45:08,440
Come.

632
00:45:11,530 --> 00:45:14,560
- You know French? - No, but you do.

633
00:45:17,050 --> 00:45:20,570
I have a certain understanding with the local police.

634
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:24,090
It's not the local police we're worried about.

635
00:45:24,920 --> 00:45:29,890
Vincent told me these men threatened to close his club down.

636
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:36,650
We've had many kinds of people threaten us in Paris...

637
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:39,910
attack us and our way of life.

638
00:45:43,340 --> 00:45:45,810
Our answer has been and will always be the same.

639
00:45:48,450 --> 00:45:49,920
Vive la résistance.

640
00:45:51,870 --> 00:45:55,740
Or like you say in English, "Fuck off."

641
00:45:58,150 --> 00:45:59,250
Give me that.

642
00:45:59,430 --> 00:46:01,000
If Will is right and

643
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:03,980
Angelica and Whispers came to London together...

644
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,580
whatever happened there could explain the rift

645
00:46:06,580 --> 00:46:08,900
that shunted Kolovi out of the picture.

646
00:46:08,900 --> 00:46:09,810
Right.

647
00:46:14,460 --> 00:46:15,460
Blocker time.

648
00:46:15,740 --> 00:46:18,250
Right. Just a moment, let me get the shot ready.

649
00:46:22,140 --> 00:46:23,080
You were right.

650
00:46:23,580 --> 00:46:25,020
Georges is one of a kind.

651
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,520
So how close were you two?

652
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:30,330
You know... close.

653
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,520
Okay, my bad cop feeling about this is buzzing.

654
00:46:38,700 --> 00:46:39,570
What?

655
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,310
Someone's following us.

656
00:47:34,290 --> 00:47:35,220
Shit.

657
00:47:36,150 --> 00:47:37,910
- Do you have your phone? - No.

658
00:47:37,910 --> 00:47:38,830
Let's go.

659
00:47:39,340 --> 00:47:40,290
Ringing.

660
00:47:40,520 --> 00:47:41,770
It just keeps ringing.

661
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:43,560
Nothing.

662
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:45,920
You can't visit?

663
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:47,940
They're on blockers.

664
00:47:50,290 --> 00:47:51,380
What about Capheus?

665
00:48:04,780 --> 00:48:05,680
What's up?

666
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,270
We have a problem.

667
00:48:12,260 --> 00:48:13,400
You're nowhere near the squat.

668
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,490
- I could drive. - You'll be too late.

669
00:48:15,490 --> 00:48:18,080
Whispers will be off the blockers if he isn't already.

670
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:20,980
This is not like Will. Something's wrong.

671
00:48:20,980 --> 00:48:21,890
Very wrong.

672
00:48:21,890 --> 00:48:23,280
In 10 minutes, Whispers will be able

673
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:24,870
to visit with anyone he's connected to.

674
00:48:24,870 --> 00:48:26,870
If he knows about where we are...

675
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:27,970
I'll go.

676
00:48:28,970 --> 00:48:29,810
What?

677
00:48:30,570 --> 00:48:32,590
No. No way.

678
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:34,500
We talked about it. He already knows me.

679
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,670
I can do the shot.

680
00:48:36,540 --> 00:48:38,390
I just need someone to watch my back.

681
00:48:41,780 --> 00:48:43,510
Anyone know how to use this thing?

682
00:49:02,800 --> 00:49:03,720
Joaquin.

683
00:49:04,610 --> 00:49:06,390
My tía always said that

684
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,130
even assholes are useful for shitting and fucking.

685
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:17,500
Oh, Ms. Caplan.

686
00:49:17,820 --> 00:49:19,880
Come to play doctors and nurses?

687
00:49:20,300 --> 00:49:22,620
Is it easy for you to sound like a creepy villain

688
00:49:22,620 --> 00:49:24,320
or is it something you have to work at?

689
00:49:24,330 --> 00:49:27,010
On the stool. Eyes to the wall. You know the routine.

690
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:35,440
And who's the sidekick's sidekick?

691
00:49:36,870 --> 00:49:40,100
Too afraid to show your Latina face?

692
00:49:41,970 --> 00:49:43,770
Aren't there more convivial ways

693
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:48,540
for two pretty ladies to occupy their time in gay Paris?

694
00:49:49,340 --> 00:49:51,070
Oh, you don't have to say anything.

695
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:54,010
Your desire for shopping is palpable.

696
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:57,850
Oh, did that hurt?

697
00:50:03,500 --> 00:50:05,890
An engagement ring, Ms. Caplan?

698
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:07,980
Given your recent failed marriage,

699
00:50:07,980 --> 00:50:11,010
I'll pass on whatever sage wisdom you were considering sharing.

700
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:12,070
Yes.

701
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:14,820
Well in due time, you too will discover

702
00:50:14,830 --> 00:50:17,440
the unbridgeable differences between our species.

703
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:22,660
It's the smallness of your kind, the limits of the sapien mind

704
00:50:22,670 --> 00:50:25,010
that attracts my kind.

705
00:50:25,900 --> 00:50:29,860
It's akin to the way humans like to keep their pets.

706
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,620
Sooner rather than later,

707
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:35,100
Ms. Marks will discover that being married to you

708
00:50:35,100 --> 00:50:38,570
is no different from being married to a Labrador bitch.

709
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,460
I never forget a face.

710
00:50:50,860 --> 00:50:52,220
I see you too.

711
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,250
Tricky.

712
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,170
And I know your kind.

713
00:51:04,950 --> 00:51:07,710
Men that mistake cruelty for strength.

714
00:51:08,670 --> 00:51:11,730
Living your petty little lives, so limited.

715
00:51:11,730 --> 00:51:14,510
We both know that if I were to pull this trigger,

716
00:51:14,520 --> 00:51:17,230
not a single person would shed a tear.

717
00:51:17,990 --> 00:51:22,350
The smallness of your kind of life is nothing to fear...

718
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:24,870
only to pity.

719
00:51:36,890 --> 00:51:38,160
Okay, that rocked!

720
00:51:41,840 --> 00:51:42,770
It was Bodhi.

721
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:43,970
From the plane?

722
00:51:44,290 --> 00:51:46,980
I thought she said it was pointless to try to change the world.

723
00:51:46,980 --> 00:51:48,790
That you can only change yourself.

724
00:51:49,170 --> 00:51:50,910
Apparently her rules have changed.

725
00:51:51,340 --> 00:51:54,620
She's not the only one changing the way the game is played.

726
00:51:54,990 --> 00:51:55,970
Mr. Hoy!

727
00:51:59,440 --> 00:52:01,500
- What's happening? - A purge!

728
00:52:01,600 --> 00:52:05,170
As you can see, the trap snaps shut.

729
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:17,250
Come on now, Ms. Blue, before they hang, draw, and quarter me.

730
00:52:17,250 --> 00:52:20,050
I've got two ladies who want words.

731
00:52:21,190 --> 00:52:25,180
You may recall your fellow countrywoman.

732
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:28,330
Yrsa?

733
00:52:29,660 --> 00:52:31,040
You're still alive!

734
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:32,860
I am, Riley.

735
00:52:33,710 --> 00:52:34,750
For now.

736
00:52:35,010 --> 00:52:36,710
Kala, what's happening?

737
00:52:37,070 --> 00:52:39,070
Riley's visiting Mr. Hoy.

738
00:52:39,800 --> 00:52:41,080
But she's here.

739
00:52:41,930 --> 00:52:42,900
Been there.

740
00:52:44,240 --> 00:52:46,670
I've been in hiding since I fled Iceland.

741
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:50,840
BPO knows that I feigned a heart attack to bring the ambulance.

742
00:52:51,190 --> 00:52:52,100
It was you.

743
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:54,390
You saved my life.

744
00:52:54,390 --> 00:52:56,020
If you want to thank me,

745
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,890
listen to the woman who urged me to help you.

746
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:03,800
Riley, I'm a sapien, so I can't see you.

747
00:53:04,940 --> 00:53:08,410
My name is River El-Saadawi. You may have heard of my mother.

748
00:53:08,970 --> 00:53:10,170
Of course.

749
00:53:10,190 --> 00:53:12,550
I lead the faction inside BPO

750
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,450
still fighting to return to the original principles

751
00:53:15,450 --> 00:53:18,150
as envisioned by my mother and Mr. Hoy.

752
00:53:20,290 --> 00:53:24,220
Those days are long gone, and I'm afeard I'm right behind them.

753
00:53:28,860 --> 00:53:29,650
Hoy.

754
00:53:29,650 --> 00:53:32,010
They're attacking our people in Manchuria.

755
00:53:32,010 --> 00:53:34,660
Evacuate whoever's left to Jeju Island.

756
00:53:35,130 --> 00:53:36,980
Godspeed, Admiral.

757
00:53:36,980 --> 00:53:38,560
You too, Speaker.

758
00:53:39,940 --> 00:53:42,700
Mr. Hoy, the Queen of Naples is behind this purge.

759
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:45,700
The mendacious minx will be coming for you next, Sutra.

760
00:53:46,220 --> 00:53:47,330
Let us help you.

761
00:53:47,470 --> 00:53:50,570
Oh, you can help me, Ms. Blue,

762
00:53:50,580 --> 00:53:54,270
by keeping your word and paying your debt to the Archipelago.

763
00:53:54,270 --> 00:53:58,290
- How? - By doing what River asks you to do!

764
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:04,180
I was hoping to have this conversation in person.

765
00:54:04,840 --> 00:54:07,320
I didn't think the situation could get any more dire

766
00:54:07,320 --> 00:54:09,840
after Richard Croome's assassination,

767
00:54:10,150 --> 00:54:13,460
but I obviously underestimated our chairman's ruthlessness.

768
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:18,560
Like you, we are now being hunted, and imprisoned or worse.

769
00:54:20,730 --> 00:54:23,110
Our only hope is if...

770
00:54:24,400 --> 00:54:25,320
If what?

771
00:54:26,500 --> 00:54:28,050
You must kill Whispers.

772
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:33,050
By killing him, you kill the drone program

773
00:54:33,230 --> 00:54:35,980
and cripple the Chairman's hold over the BPO.

774
00:54:37,110 --> 00:54:38,930
I know what it will cost you,

775
00:54:39,360 --> 00:54:40,950
but this is war.

776
00:54:43,010 --> 00:54:44,460
What? What's going on?

777
00:54:44,460 --> 00:54:46,380
It's some kind of organized attack.

778
00:54:46,770 --> 00:54:48,450
BPO has found Hoy.

779
00:54:50,190 --> 00:54:53,240
Ms. El-Saadawi believes that their only hope...

780
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,980
is if we kill Whispers.

781
00:54:56,910 --> 00:55:00,000
But then they will kill Wolfgang.

782
00:55:13,970 --> 00:55:15,000
I'm sorry.

783
00:55:17,390 --> 00:55:18,580
We had to try.

784
00:55:20,860 --> 00:55:22,150
Take your blocker, dear.

785
00:55:22,150 --> 00:55:23,760
Exposure is dangerous.

786
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:29,630
Riley, I pray that one day

787
00:55:29,630 --> 00:55:32,250
we'll somehow emerge from this darkness.

788
00:55:35,470 --> 00:55:36,370
Thank you.

789
00:55:37,930 --> 00:55:38,890
This is it.

790
00:55:40,280 --> 00:55:41,700
This is the end.

791
00:55:45,600 --> 00:55:47,100
Goodbye, Mr. Hoy.

792
00:55:48,250 --> 00:55:49,150
Goodbye.

793
00:55:57,350 --> 00:55:58,480
Where are you going?

794
00:56:12,650 --> 00:56:15,420
I've-- I've nowhere left to run.

795
00:56:19,340 --> 00:56:21,260
You may wish to look away.

796
00:56:21,600 --> 00:56:22,980
Don't give up. Please.

797
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:27,750
Bless you, lassie, but I'm the Speaker of the Archipelago.

798
00:56:27,760 --> 00:56:29,990
I can't let BPO get hold of me.

799
00:56:29,990 --> 00:56:32,500
Don't say that. I got you into this.

800
00:56:32,500 --> 00:56:34,430
If we hadn't met in Amsterdam, you'd still be--

801
00:56:34,430 --> 00:56:38,560
Cowering in my coffin, living like a hunted rat?

802
00:56:38,560 --> 00:56:40,350
Aye. I would, Ms. Blue.

803
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:45,510
But if I died there, I'd die soused in regret.

804
00:56:46,100 --> 00:56:47,020
If I die here--

805
00:56:47,020 --> 00:56:48,600
That's it.

806
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,680
Let's nip in the bud all this nonsense about dying.

807
00:56:52,680 --> 00:56:54,540
- Aunt Kirsty? - Mrs. Stromness?

808
00:56:54,540 --> 00:56:55,770
How did you get here?

809
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:57,900
By taxi, you great numpty.

810
00:56:57,900 --> 00:57:01,110
What? But... you shouldn't be here!

811
00:57:01,150 --> 00:57:02,090
It's not safe.

812
00:57:02,090 --> 00:57:03,400
Well, it's a great deal safer now

813
00:57:03,400 --> 00:57:05,890
since I chucked the bullets out the window.

814
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:09,090
What have you done?

815
00:57:10,080 --> 00:57:11,030
Look...

816
00:57:11,380 --> 00:57:14,330
I promised Angus I'd mind you.

817
00:57:14,690 --> 00:57:16,410
So take a blocker.

818
00:57:16,410 --> 00:57:21,270
If we're arrested, it will buy you a period of grace.

819
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:24,670
You-- You knew?

820
00:57:25,410 --> 00:57:28,530
About Homo sensorium?

821
00:57:28,760 --> 00:57:32,280
I was Angus' wife for 40 years.

822
00:57:32,900 --> 00:57:36,620
You can't love someone like I loved Angus

823
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,050
and not know a thing like that.

824
00:57:40,310 --> 00:57:41,590
Take your medicine.

825
00:57:41,590 --> 00:57:45,030
Don't worry about me. I'll be fine.

826
00:57:45,860 --> 00:57:47,940
- Go! Go! - Clear!

827
00:57:48,060 --> 00:57:49,010
Freeze!

828
00:57:49,840 --> 00:57:52,050
- What happened? - Did Hoy survive?

829
00:57:52,150 --> 00:57:53,210
I don't know.

830
00:57:55,210 --> 00:57:56,720
The connection was broken.

831
00:57:58,110 --> 00:57:59,210
Now he's gone.

832
00:58:14,010 --> 00:58:16,150
You're supposed to say trick or treat.

833
00:58:16,300 --> 00:58:21,110
Cluster zero eight zero eight. Code FH.

834
00:58:21,110 --> 00:58:24,170
F for feral, H for hostile.

835
00:58:24,170 --> 00:58:26,490
And CH is for Chairman.

836
00:58:26,770 --> 00:58:28,800
And also chickenshit.

837
00:58:29,130 --> 00:58:33,210
I'm no more afraid of you than a doctor fears illness.

838
00:58:33,210 --> 00:58:34,680
Then take off your mask.

839
00:58:34,810 --> 00:58:38,760
Anonymity is a regrettable necessity of this war.

840
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:41,370
But when at last it is over,

841
00:58:41,370 --> 00:58:45,530
I imagine my efforts may well remain uncredited,

842
00:58:45,530 --> 00:58:47,670
which is as it should be.

843
00:58:47,670 --> 00:58:50,190
My work is its own reward.

844
00:58:50,650 --> 00:58:51,660
Don't worry.

845
00:58:52,290 --> 00:58:55,110
I'm going to make sure you get everything you are due.

846
00:58:56,220 --> 00:59:00,510
For millennia, my kind have subjugated yours.

847
00:59:01,700 --> 00:59:03,060
Do you know why?

848
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:08,530
Certainty.

849
00:59:09,230 --> 00:59:12,830
There is only one voice telling me what to do.

850
00:59:13,310 --> 00:59:14,220
You?

851
00:59:14,370 --> 00:59:15,380
You grabbed a gun

852
00:59:15,380 --> 00:59:18,610
and you had the opportunity to destroy all my efforts,

853
00:59:18,610 --> 00:59:20,900
but you failed.

854
00:59:20,990 --> 00:59:24,780
Your kind suffer from too many conflicting thoughts,

855
00:59:24,780 --> 00:59:29,250
too many clamoring voices inside your skulls.

856
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:34,980
Fortunately, I know a single, simple cure to shut them all up.

857
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:36,980
Come on.

858
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:39,510
Pull that fucking trigger.

859
00:59:39,880 --> 00:59:42,790
You chicken-fucking shit! Come on! Show me your certainty!

860
00:59:42,800 --> 00:59:44,470
You cockless fuck, do it!

861
00:59:50,360 --> 00:59:52,740
You will leave us in the morning.

862
00:59:52,740 --> 00:59:55,630
I await your swift and certain return.

863
00:59:56,910 --> 00:59:58,110
You and me both.

864
01:00:05,270 --> 01:00:07,260
Communication is crucial.

865
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:23,640
In The Devil Died at Dawn,

866
01:00:23,640 --> 01:00:25,420
there was a hostage exchange at a club.

867
01:00:25,430 --> 01:00:28,010
- It was a bullfighting stadium. - Was it?

868
01:00:28,290 --> 01:00:30,820
Oh, yeah, and the bull gored you--

869
01:00:30,820 --> 01:00:31,590
Guys?

870
01:00:32,530 --> 01:00:33,340
Sorry.

871
01:00:44,650 --> 01:00:46,570
The blocker should have metabolized by now.

872
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:47,780
Wolfgang!

873
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:56,810
Are you all right?

874
01:00:59,250 --> 01:01:00,790
Hello, sexy.

875
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:01,760
No!

876
01:01:01,760 --> 01:01:03,860
I told you our fates were connected.

877
01:01:07,010 --> 01:01:08,270
What is she doing here?

878
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,460
Your cluster wanted to make sure you were undamaged

879
01:01:10,460 --> 01:01:12,350
and we want the same thing.

880
01:01:12,650 --> 01:01:14,770
Ms. Facchini is the only sensate

881
01:01:14,770 --> 01:01:16,910
connected to both you and Milton.

882
01:01:17,320 --> 01:01:18,590
Lucky me.

883
01:01:22,900 --> 01:01:24,830
Ready to come home, Milton?

884
01:01:32,090 --> 01:01:33,630
In order to execute the exchange,

885
01:01:33,630 --> 01:01:36,060
one of us is going to have to make contact with Lila.

886
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,530
Since I'm already connected to Whispers,

887
01:01:39,530 --> 01:01:41,470
it just makes sense that it would be me.

888
01:01:48,180 --> 01:01:52,400
BPO will lock the area down straight after the exchange.

889
01:02:00,960 --> 01:02:02,560
We've been monitoring local police

890
01:02:02,560 --> 01:02:03,990
and BPO isn't involving them

891
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,620
beyond the standard terror alerts.

892
01:02:05,630 --> 01:02:08,010
We think we can use that to our advantage.

893
01:02:08,010 --> 01:02:11,060
Who looks more like a terrorist organization than BPO?

894
01:02:15,650 --> 01:02:16,990
Officers!

895
01:02:19,550 --> 01:02:20,620
Officers!

896
01:02:20,620 --> 01:02:22,420
- Please. - Yes, sir?

897
01:02:22,420 --> 01:02:23,680
Brave chiefs of the law.

898
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:24,790
I'm listening, sir.

899
01:02:25,090 --> 01:02:26,530
There is a threat right behind me.

900
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:27,820
Excuse me?

901
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:31,300
- Terrorists. - Terrorists?

902
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:33,360
They are going to attack! Protect the people!

903
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:34,780
- Don't joke. - Protect the people!

904
01:02:34,780 --> 01:02:36,430
- Let's go! - Watch out!

905
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:37,750
Watch out!

906
01:02:37,930 --> 01:02:40,410
Watch out! Watch out!

907
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,240
Get out of the car!

908
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:47,650
Get out of the car!

909
01:02:47,800 --> 01:02:48,990
Hands up!

910
01:02:52,770 --> 01:02:55,540
In view of our apartment evacuation,

911
01:02:55,590 --> 01:03:00,020
we've relocated logistic support to a mobile response vehicle.

913
01:03:16,910 --> 01:03:20,630
I can't believe I'm actually in one of those planning scenes.

914
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,510
- Bug. - Sorry.

915
01:03:23,320 --> 01:03:28,630
It's my pleasure to report the Bugmobile is

916
01:03:29,090 --> 01:03:30,920
nearly operational.

917
01:03:31,180 --> 01:03:33,180
We told you we needed it now.

918
01:03:33,280 --> 01:03:34,300
Did I say "nearly"?

919
01:03:34,300 --> 01:03:38,840
I meant totally, absolutely ready to roll. I mean...

920
01:03:38,840 --> 01:03:40,300
Yeah, that's it.

921
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:42,180
Bug!

922
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:43,850
Shit!

923
01:03:43,860 --> 01:03:45,350
I mean, merde!

924
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,680
So once we've set the time and place,

925
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,570
we need as many eyes on Sans Jour as possible.

926
01:04:02,910 --> 01:04:04,590
The metal detectors will help,

927
01:04:04,590 --> 01:04:07,140
but we should assume they won't play by the rules.

928
01:04:25,180 --> 01:04:26,760
BPO will send every cop or agent

929
01:04:26,760 --> 01:04:29,350
they have as soon as they have the exchange point.

930
01:04:30,090 --> 01:04:31,930
Hello.

931
01:04:33,050 --> 01:04:34,400
Buy me a drink?

932
01:04:34,430 --> 01:04:35,600
Sorry, honey.

933
01:04:42,340 --> 01:04:43,180
Gay?

934
01:04:45,720 --> 01:04:46,680
We wish.

935
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,480
Two at the bar are cops. Definitely cops.

936
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:52,230
Got it.

937
01:04:53,480 --> 01:04:56,790
Capheus will drop us here.

938
01:05:07,010 --> 01:05:07,950
We are here.

939
01:05:13,900 --> 01:05:14,800
Ready.

940
01:05:15,190 --> 01:05:16,660
I scouted the exit.

941
01:05:17,050 --> 01:05:18,520
The van's almost ready.

943
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,140
Do you think we have any chance of surviving this?

944
01:05:26,970 --> 01:05:29,970
I did not think I would survive prison.

945
01:05:30,490 --> 01:05:33,460
I did not think I would survive the Bak Gala.

946
01:05:33,490 --> 01:05:34,950
And the truth is...

947
01:05:36,560 --> 01:05:38,020
I did not.

948
01:05:39,560 --> 01:05:40,760
We did.

949
01:05:43,160 --> 01:05:46,970
Yeah, I have a good feeling about this too.

950
01:05:55,150 --> 01:05:58,050
Spirit of Jean-Claude.

951
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:11,430
We have control of street security cameras.

952
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,170
We're waiting to hear about ones in the club.

953
01:06:13,170 --> 01:06:15,510
Georges sent the codes. You should be able to log on.

954
01:06:15,510 --> 01:06:16,530
Checking them now.

955
01:06:16,730 --> 01:06:17,810
There's Wolfgang.

956
01:06:20,280 --> 01:06:22,340
We got Lila entering the club.

957
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,590
Once we have Wolfgang, we get out

958
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:29,890
and make our separate ways to the rendezvous.

959
01:06:32,250 --> 01:06:33,890
In order to evacuate the club

960
01:06:33,890 --> 01:06:36,450
without causing any panic or stampede,

961
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,420
I thought of smoke pots,

962
01:06:39,420 --> 01:06:41,950
which we use at festivals.

963
01:06:42,290 --> 01:06:43,600
By adding a few spices,

964
01:06:43,610 --> 01:06:45,910
I was able to make the smell quite intense,

965
01:06:45,910 --> 01:06:48,200
which I think will cause people--

966
01:06:54,650 --> 01:06:56,550
So that proves that--

967
01:07:05,410 --> 01:07:07,610
Okay. This is it.

968
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:44,410
Do you see that woman?

969
01:07:44,980 --> 01:07:46,480
Keep us close to her.

970
01:08:12,490 --> 01:08:13,330
Will!

971
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:15,120
It's Bodhi!

972
01:08:40,570 --> 01:08:42,480
- What's happening? - I lost Whispers!

973
01:08:42,480 --> 01:08:43,670
They lost him.

974
01:08:44,730 --> 01:08:45,560
Fuck!

975
01:08:52,250 --> 01:08:53,420
I got him.

976
01:08:55,070 --> 01:08:57,980
Sorry, lover. This is goodbye.

977
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:01,560
- She's pointing a gun! - No!

978
01:09:28,440 --> 01:09:29,590
Start the exit.

979
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:31,720
Everybody out of the pool.

980
01:09:31,720 --> 01:09:34,680
Dani, Hernando, drop the pots.

981
01:09:50,460 --> 01:09:51,740
Everyone better get out of there.

982
01:09:51,740 --> 01:09:52,870
Where is Kala?

983
01:09:53,030 --> 01:09:54,140
I don't know.

984
01:09:54,770 --> 01:09:56,680
Lito, Dani, and Hernando have her.

985
01:09:56,870 --> 01:09:58,200
They're heading for the metro.

986
01:09:58,200 --> 01:10:00,170
Come on, let's go! Come on!

987
01:10:01,800 --> 01:10:02,610
Make the change.

988
01:10:02,610 --> 01:10:03,490
Right.

990
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:17,390
Ah, Ms. Facchini.

991
01:10:29,310 --> 01:10:32,020
Milton... at last.

992
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:50,180
Exit here and go right.

993
01:10:57,120 --> 01:10:58,110
Hold it.

994
01:10:58,350 --> 01:11:00,290
- Is everyone out? - So far.

995
01:11:00,300 --> 01:11:03,160
I've got Lito, Hernando, Dani, and Kala.

996
01:11:03,160 --> 01:11:05,890
- Were you scared? - It was frightening like a movie, yes.

997
01:11:05,890 --> 01:11:08,380
But it was real, which made it in a certain way--

998
01:11:08,380 --> 01:11:11,080
It was the most freaking amazing experience of my life!

999
01:11:12,970 --> 01:11:14,360
What about Wolfgang?

1000
01:11:14,550 --> 01:11:15,350
I'm good.

1001
01:11:16,950 --> 01:11:18,120
Where's Rajan?

1002
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:20,720
He's with me. I'll meet you at the rendezvous.

1003
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,350
All right.

1004
01:11:27,830 --> 01:11:28,640
Go on.

1005
01:11:30,960 --> 01:11:32,800
Wait. What about Sun?

1006
01:11:36,890 --> 01:11:39,250
Hey you! Stop!

1007
01:11:51,450 --> 01:11:53,130
Get on the ground! Hands on your head.

1008
01:11:53,130 --> 01:11:54,650
- Hands on your head! - Get down!

1009
01:11:55,450 --> 01:11:56,880
On your knees! Don't move!

1010
01:11:56,890 --> 01:11:59,060
Get her down. We'll bring her with the others.

1011
01:12:00,380 --> 01:12:01,450
Excuse me, officers.

1012
01:12:02,720 --> 01:12:04,650
But I have a warrant for that woman right there.

1013
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:06,840
I don't know who you are or what language that is,

1014
01:12:06,840 --> 01:12:08,960
but you need to turn around and walk away.

1015
01:12:09,370 --> 01:12:10,870
Sorry, she's coming with me.

1016
01:12:11,360 --> 01:12:13,230
I said, fuck off!

1017
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,560
Bonsoir, Ms. Bak.

1018
01:12:34,780 --> 01:12:36,220
What are you doing here?

1019
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,200
Had some vacation days saved up.

1020
01:12:39,760 --> 01:12:41,210
Never been to Paris.

1021
01:12:43,050 --> 01:12:45,220
I've heard people fall in love here all the time.

1022
01:12:45,420 --> 01:12:48,210
Be serious. How did you find me?

1023
01:12:48,270 --> 01:12:51,550
In my 13 years on the force, I never committed a felony.

1024
01:12:51,790 --> 01:12:54,370
But regrettably, that is no longer true.

1025
01:12:55,140 --> 01:12:57,340
I illegally used a satellite tracking system

1026
01:12:57,340 --> 01:13:00,370
to find someone who was no longer wanted by the police

1027
01:13:00,380 --> 01:13:02,560
but who happened to call me...

1028
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:05,750
with this phone.

1029
01:13:13,970 --> 01:13:15,900
I'll have to report you.

1030
01:13:17,600 --> 01:13:18,590
Of course.

1031
01:13:24,380 --> 01:13:25,250
Are you going to tell me

1032
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:28,600
why you went to all this trouble, Detective?

1033
01:13:30,350 --> 01:13:32,750
I'm not really good with words, Ms. Bak.

1034
01:13:37,430 --> 01:13:39,510
Would you mind if I showed you instead?

1035
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:52,810
Okay... I found Sun.

1036
01:13:53,060 --> 01:13:55,700
She's good. Like, really good.

1037
01:13:56,600 --> 01:13:57,480
How--

1038
01:13:57,770 --> 01:13:59,620
I told her to throw that phone away.

1039
01:13:59,620 --> 01:14:02,340
Those things are so easy to track.

1040
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:03,720
Didn't she know that?

1041
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:06,630
I did, so technically...

1042
01:14:09,760 --> 01:14:11,550
Hey, come on. What about Lila?

1043
01:14:11,550 --> 01:14:13,210
Right, Lila.

1044
01:14:13,210 --> 01:14:15,460
They're just leaving the 11th arrondissement.

1045
01:14:18,370 --> 01:14:21,600
I need a meeting with the Chairman immediately.

1046
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:22,860
I want to personally head

1047
01:14:22,860 --> 01:14:26,150
the task force that hunts these animals down.

1048
01:14:26,380 --> 01:14:29,120
And will someone get these things off me?

1049
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,790
In a moment, darling.

1050
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:34,070
That's her.

1051
01:14:35,650 --> 01:14:36,740
Is that our siren?

1052
01:14:36,920 --> 01:14:37,980
That's not us.

1053
01:14:38,310 --> 01:14:39,440
Something's wrong.

1054
01:14:42,290 --> 01:14:43,760
Driver, what's happening?

1055
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,030
It was Lila.

1056
01:15:47,690 --> 01:15:49,130
She set us up.

1057
01:15:50,610 --> 01:15:51,540
Now what?

1058
01:15:54,890 --> 01:15:57,000
Rajan. This place is amazing.

1059
01:15:57,100 --> 01:16:00,320
Yeah. My friend, Jean-Pierre, has owned it for years.

1060
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:17,600
They'll be here soon.

1061
01:16:21,420 --> 01:16:22,310
Rajan...

1062
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:26,720
most men wouldn't have done what you did for me.

1063
01:16:29,010 --> 01:16:30,110
I did what I could.

1064
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:33,120
I'll never forget it.

1065
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:41,640
Here they come.

1066
01:16:47,740 --> 01:16:49,320
Oh, Ganesha.

1067
01:16:50,950 --> 01:16:52,200
What do I do here?

1068
01:16:53,570 --> 01:16:55,130
What rules do I follow?

1069
01:17:02,940 --> 01:17:04,010
If I may?

1070
01:17:04,700 --> 01:17:06,740
Since you can, in fact,

1071
01:17:06,740 --> 01:17:10,220
be in more than two places at the same time,

1072
01:17:10,330 --> 01:17:12,890
defying several laws of physics,

1073
01:17:12,920 --> 01:17:18,090
I would suggest that... there are no rules.

1074
01:17:48,290 --> 01:17:53,560
Rajan, you are so much more than the man I thought I married.

1075
01:19:12,440 --> 01:19:13,770
Yeah, definitely.

1076
01:19:22,060 --> 01:19:23,780
Guys, how about some bubbly?

1077
01:19:29,370 --> 01:19:31,260
One, two, three!

1078
01:19:35,220 --> 01:19:36,860
Have you ever tried it yet?

1079
01:19:41,020 --> 01:19:42,440
To my friend Jean-Pierre!

1080
01:19:47,400 --> 01:19:50,340
Wait. I want to say something.

1081
01:19:54,680 --> 01:19:59,430
I have lived much of my life with one friend,

1082
01:19:59,430 --> 01:20:01,410
with my one brother.

1083
01:20:03,830 --> 01:20:06,590
And I never knew what it was like to...

1084
01:20:08,360 --> 01:20:12,870
have people in your life that would fight for someone like me.

1085
01:20:14,700 --> 01:20:15,510
Thank you.

1086
01:20:16,200 --> 01:20:18,150
You big German lug.

1087
01:20:19,290 --> 01:20:20,790
- We love you! - Thank you.

1088
01:20:24,120 --> 01:20:26,020
- Cheers. - Cheers.

1089
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:31,360
Even after everything we've been through...

1090
01:20:33,550 --> 01:20:37,320
would any of us go back to the world we're used to?

1091
01:20:37,980 --> 01:20:41,440
Even if that world included Milton Brandt.

1092
01:20:42,860 --> 01:20:43,750
Bodhi.

1093
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:45,550
She's back?

1094
01:20:45,880 --> 01:20:48,680
She's not here, but she's in your head?

1095
01:20:48,680 --> 01:20:53,010
I'm confused. We've never met, but I can see you.

1096
01:20:53,140 --> 01:20:53,980
Me too.

1097
01:20:54,020 --> 01:20:56,430
There are things I can explain and things I cannot.

1098
01:20:56,430 --> 01:21:00,190
But before I begin, you must accept the Mother's invitation.

1099
01:21:08,210 --> 01:21:09,690
Who is the Mother?

1100
01:21:23,860 --> 01:21:24,840
I am.

1101
01:21:26,200 --> 01:21:27,170
Welcome.

1102
01:21:28,270 --> 01:21:30,250
This is the Lacuna.

1103
01:21:32,300 --> 01:21:33,770
You have questions.

1104
01:21:33,770 --> 01:21:36,820
Actually, yes. Um, to begin with, "Lacuna"?

1105
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:40,550
A temple, a college, a discipline, or what precisely?

1106
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,200
A home.

1107
01:21:43,200 --> 01:21:48,530
The Lacuna exists between that which is theirs or ours,

1108
01:21:49,160 --> 01:21:51,190
and the sensates who live here

1109
01:21:51,190 --> 01:21:55,580
curate a unique corpus of knowledge passed down centuries.

1110
01:21:55,750 --> 01:22:00,460
We are in the world, but not of the world.

1111
01:22:00,460 --> 01:22:01,980
You seem pretty of this world

1112
01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,050
when you sent her to follow us and kill Brandt.

1113
01:22:05,280 --> 01:22:10,170
One day, I believe, Bodhi will sit here.

1114
01:22:11,920 --> 01:22:14,210
Mother of a future Lacuna.

1115
01:22:14,770 --> 01:22:18,370
It is both a worry and a source of hope

1116
01:22:18,370 --> 01:22:22,020
that she retains a certain independence of mind.

1117
01:22:22,240 --> 01:22:24,450
Brandt must be destroyed.

1118
01:22:24,800 --> 01:22:27,670
You think Brandt is working with sapiens.

1119
01:22:27,670 --> 01:22:30,690
But we here in the Lacuna know his true goal.

1120
01:22:31,120 --> 01:22:33,240
You mean the drone assassin program.

1121
01:22:33,240 --> 01:22:36,770
No. Brandt is manipulating BPO.

1122
01:22:37,250 --> 01:22:38,280
For what?

1123
01:22:41,290 --> 01:22:43,780
I am a trinity of mothers.

1124
01:22:44,340 --> 01:22:48,530
I gave birth long ago to a girl who lived to be a mother herself.

1125
01:22:48,830 --> 01:22:51,820
I am the Mother of the Lacuna.

1126
01:22:53,210 --> 01:22:57,160
And I am the mother of my own cluster.

1127
01:22:57,680 --> 01:23:00,630
Only one of my eight remains.

1128
01:23:00,960 --> 01:23:02,700
He has many names,

1129
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:06,680
but his original one is Milton Brandt.

1130
01:23:07,430 --> 01:23:08,900
You're Whisper's mother?

1131
01:23:10,500 --> 01:23:13,420
I was not then who I am now.

1132
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:16,730
What mother could be unchanged

1133
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:19,920
by the murder of her seven children

1134
01:23:20,010 --> 01:23:21,490
by the eighth?

1135
01:23:22,390 --> 01:23:24,810
I felt each one...

1136
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:29,000
their anguish...

1137
01:23:30,170 --> 01:23:31,490
their terror...

1138
01:23:35,200 --> 01:23:36,760
Their deaths.

1139
01:23:39,250 --> 01:23:41,110
I tried to stop him.

1140
01:23:43,320 --> 01:23:44,450
Failed.

1141
01:23:45,950 --> 01:23:48,600
It was unbearable.

1142
01:23:50,380 --> 01:23:53,860
I fled from my life...

1143
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:56,810
from myself...

1144
01:23:57,660 --> 01:23:59,260
from the world...

1145
01:23:59,910 --> 01:24:01,590
until I came here.

1146
01:24:03,510 --> 01:24:05,900
The Lacuna strikes me as very powerful.

1147
01:24:06,770 --> 01:24:08,990
Why wait until now to try to stop him?

1148
01:24:09,820 --> 01:24:13,260
Clustercide wreaks a terrible price.

1149
01:24:14,030 --> 01:24:17,230
My son experienced his cluster's deaths

1150
01:24:17,230 --> 01:24:20,680
both as murderer and murdered.

1151
01:24:20,920 --> 01:24:24,370
A dread of dying has poisoned his soul.

1152
01:24:25,580 --> 01:24:27,740
But what does that have to do with the drone program?

1153
01:24:30,870 --> 01:24:32,200
The zombies.

1154
01:24:32,870 --> 01:24:36,700
If Whispers could inhabit them with his consciousness intact...

1155
01:24:36,750 --> 01:24:39,050
And if he had enough of them...

1156
01:24:41,650 --> 01:24:43,310
Then he could live forever.

1157
01:24:44,320 --> 01:24:49,170
The Lacuna prizes its neutrality, but Bodhi argued...

1158
01:24:49,170 --> 01:24:53,720
That neutrality, in the face of such evil, is complicity.

1159
01:24:53,750 --> 01:24:55,270
Her view prevailed.

1160
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:59,070
And the Lacuna resolved to intervene.

1161
01:24:59,710 --> 01:25:01,520
Can you help us find Whispers?

1162
01:25:02,680 --> 01:25:06,800
Mothers and children retain a connection.

1163
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:12,990
There is an umbilical cord that remains uncut...

1164
01:25:15,780 --> 01:25:17,080
until death.

1165
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:44,570
I'm still surprised you agreed to help us.

1166
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,400
At this point, Ms. Bak,

1167
01:25:49,720 --> 01:25:51,750
you'll have a hard time getting rid of me.

1168
01:26:09,160 --> 01:26:12,100
Don't tell me you speak Italian as well.

1169
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:13,620
Ma certo.

1170
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,740
Another language of love?

1171
01:26:16,450 --> 01:26:20,780
For the Bug, love has no nationality.

1172
01:26:25,060 --> 01:26:28,180
Can you believe yesterday I thought the worst thing in my life

1173
01:26:28,180 --> 01:26:30,750
was being subpoenaed for a corruption trial,

1174
01:26:30,760 --> 01:26:33,820
and today I am heading to Naples to stop a nefarious organization

1175
01:26:33,820 --> 01:26:36,340
from using a secret human species,

1176
01:26:36,390 --> 01:26:39,040
which my wife is a member of, as suicide assassins.

1177
01:26:39,040 --> 01:26:40,510
What was that, Rajan?

1178
01:26:43,150 --> 01:26:46,170
I said... things change so fast.

1179
01:26:46,170 --> 01:26:47,610
Yeah. So fast!

1180
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,340
Like driving on clouds, yeah?

1181
01:26:49,810 --> 01:26:51,970
Yeah, like driving on clouds.

1182
01:27:07,630 --> 01:27:09,510
You can hear her music?

1183
01:27:09,860 --> 01:27:11,110
If I want to.

1184
01:27:31,100 --> 01:27:32,310
Love that song.

1185
01:27:35,020 --> 01:27:35,550
Turn it up.

1186
01:28:58,270 --> 01:28:59,510
What?

1187
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:00,630
What?

1188
01:29:01,730 --> 01:29:02,530
No.

1189
01:29:02,530 --> 01:29:04,200
Oh, my God!

1190
01:29:05,760 --> 01:29:07,100
Oh, my God! I can't believe you're here

1191
01:29:07,110 --> 01:29:08,910
and not in lots of little pieces.

1192
01:29:09,020 --> 01:29:11,640
Wolfie, I was worried this time.

1193
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,340
- Glad to see you too, brother. - Yeah.

1194
01:29:17,860 --> 01:29:19,000
My brother, Felix!

1195
01:29:20,660 --> 01:29:21,770
This is Capheus.

1196
01:29:23,480 --> 01:29:24,300
Okay.

1197
01:29:25,750 --> 01:29:28,310
And you must be India Plan.

1198
01:29:28,950 --> 01:29:31,340
Um, I'm Kala. It's nice to finally meet.

1199
01:29:31,340 --> 01:29:33,050
Yeah. Good to meet you.

1200
01:29:33,120 --> 01:29:34,400
And I'm Rajan.

1201
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:35,770
My husband.

1202
01:29:39,070 --> 01:29:40,270
It's complicated.

1203
01:29:41,430 --> 01:29:44,500
Well, let me show you something that's not complicated.

1204
01:29:46,140 --> 01:29:48,720
Compliments from Sebastian Fuchs.

1205
01:29:49,050 --> 01:29:52,470
Herr Fuchs is a firm believer in the moral necessity of revenge

1206
01:29:52,470 --> 01:29:54,870
and he hopes his gifts will be useful to you against,

1207
01:29:54,870 --> 01:29:57,790
and I'm quoting, "The Neapolitan bitch."

1208
01:29:58,850 --> 01:30:00,370
He included your favorite toy.

1209
01:30:01,780 --> 01:30:05,570
For old time's sake.

1210
01:30:11,780 --> 01:30:13,150
No.

1211
01:30:19,660 --> 01:30:21,160
What did he say?

1212
01:30:21,330 --> 01:30:24,400
Naples. The end of the line.

1213
01:30:26,720 --> 01:30:28,230
Of course.

1214
01:30:28,430 --> 01:30:29,670
Let me guess, this is your

1215
01:30:29,670 --> 01:30:32,380
"It's hopeless, Will, turn back now" speech?

1216
01:30:32,690 --> 01:30:33,900
I know you won't listen to me,

1217
01:30:33,910 --> 01:30:38,100
but if I don't say this to you, I will regret it.

1218
01:30:38,250 --> 01:30:40,550
We talked once of secrets.

1219
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:44,940
How their world is built of and on secrets.

1220
01:30:45,190 --> 01:30:47,130
One way to survive inside that kind of world

1221
01:30:47,140 --> 01:30:49,210
is to become a secret yourself.

1222
01:30:50,340 --> 01:30:51,730
What secret?

1223
01:30:55,370 --> 01:30:57,170
The same secret I have kept

1224
01:30:57,170 --> 01:30:59,010
and I must continue to keep

1225
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:01,980
even as I ask you to stay away from Naples.

1226
01:31:01,980 --> 01:31:03,570
Nice try, Jonas.

1227
01:31:03,570 --> 01:31:04,350
But after watching you

1228
01:31:04,350 --> 01:31:06,630
sip cocktails while we were being tortured,

1229
01:31:06,630 --> 01:31:07,590
our confidence in your ability

1230
01:31:07,590 --> 01:31:10,260
to finish this fight is not particularly high.

1231
01:31:12,380 --> 01:31:14,340
Mr. Gorski.

1232
01:31:16,610 --> 01:31:19,110
The man everyone underestimates.

1233
01:31:19,660 --> 01:31:22,640
And Wolfgang, the man everybody wants.

1234
01:31:23,760 --> 01:31:25,380
Welcome to my home.

1235
01:31:25,670 --> 01:31:28,530
I can tell you're going to keep me up at night, aren't you?

1236
01:31:31,040 --> 01:31:32,820
Missed you, sexy.

1237
01:31:33,600 --> 01:31:35,980
I don't associate happy thoughts with murder,

1238
01:31:36,120 --> 01:31:38,260
but I think I'm going to enjoy killing you.

1239
01:31:38,940 --> 01:31:41,720
You were a lot more fun when we first met.

1240
01:31:44,800 --> 01:31:46,440
How about you, Officer?

1241
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:49,840
Are you any fun?

1242
01:31:49,980 --> 01:31:51,330
Me?

1243
01:31:51,330 --> 01:31:53,080
I'm the life of the party,

1244
01:31:53,130 --> 01:31:55,270
especially when Camorra queens help shadow governments

1245
01:31:55,270 --> 01:31:58,070
hunt down and lobotomize people I care about.

1246
01:31:58,650 --> 01:32:01,370
Difficult times, difficult choices.

1247
01:32:03,420 --> 01:32:05,630
BPO is like any government.

1248
01:32:05,910 --> 01:32:08,650
To deal with them, you have to speak their language:

1249
01:32:09,260 --> 01:32:10,630
force.

1250
01:32:11,790 --> 01:32:14,320
I told you this cluster would not go away.

1251
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:16,170
They are too late.

1252
01:32:19,200 --> 01:32:21,870
But I'm pleased you came to my city.

1253
01:32:22,280 --> 01:32:24,920
You will witness a turning point in our struggle.

1254
01:32:25,690 --> 01:32:28,570
I told you I was going to build a sanctuary, Wolfgang.

1255
01:32:29,460 --> 01:32:31,730
And what better place than my Napoli?

1256
01:32:32,320 --> 01:32:35,020
Here, memories live beside history,

1257
01:32:35,650 --> 01:32:37,690
history beside memories.

1258
01:32:39,220 --> 01:32:41,620
Right there is where I had my first kiss.

1259
01:32:42,750 --> 01:32:43,800
And just ahead is the square

1260
01:32:43,800 --> 01:32:45,560
where Masaniello, a common fisherman,

1261
01:32:45,570 --> 01:32:48,310
stood up to the Spanish Empire and ignited a revolution

1262
01:32:48,310 --> 01:32:50,960
that created the first Neapolitan Republic.

1263
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,680
Fuck that.

1264
01:32:52,730 --> 01:32:55,630
You're not a revolutionary. Just another collaborator.

1265
01:32:58,970 --> 01:33:02,000
- Stay back. - I can take him.

1266
01:33:02,170 --> 01:33:04,330
Not now. There is too much at stake.

1267
01:33:07,650 --> 01:33:10,300
This city has existed for thousands of years.

1268
01:33:11,360 --> 01:33:13,700
Empires and armies came and went,

1269
01:33:13,780 --> 01:33:15,710
and our home still stands.

1270
01:33:19,770 --> 01:33:21,810
Someone will survive this war.

1271
01:33:23,700 --> 01:33:25,470
That someone will be me.

1272
01:33:46,450 --> 01:33:49,340
Let's dig in. Dig in.

1273
01:33:53,070 --> 01:33:54,580
Oh, my God.

1274
01:33:57,770 --> 01:34:00,490
If I had to choose a final meal,

1275
01:34:00,670 --> 01:34:02,150
it would be pizza!

1276
01:34:02,840 --> 01:34:05,250
I spent a while here, laying in a hospital bed

1277
01:34:05,250 --> 01:34:06,880
and I have never eaten so well.

1278
01:34:08,950 --> 01:34:10,870
I was in a hospital too!

1279
01:34:11,240 --> 01:34:12,560
Terrible food, man.

1280
01:34:12,670 --> 01:34:13,780
What happened to you?

1281
01:34:13,790 --> 01:34:16,110
It's probably the funniest honeymoon story you've ever heard.

1282
01:34:16,110 --> 01:34:19,270
Rajan, right now is probably not the right time to tell them.

1283
01:34:25,100 --> 01:34:28,120
Oh, my God, we're in Naples.

1284
01:34:28,640 --> 01:34:30,310
This is amazing!

1285
01:34:30,740 --> 01:34:32,560
International Most Wanted!

1286
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:33,990
Diego!

1287
01:34:36,340 --> 01:34:37,730
What's up, Iceland?

1288
01:34:38,030 --> 01:34:39,550
Good to see you.

1289
01:34:41,630 --> 01:34:42,800
You made it.

1290
01:34:42,800 --> 01:34:45,400
Of course I did, because if I asked you to aid and abet

1291
01:34:45,410 --> 01:34:48,170
who knows what felonies in foreign jurisdictions,

1292
01:34:48,510 --> 01:34:50,840
I'm sure you'd drop everything and race to the airport too.

1293
01:34:51,690 --> 01:34:55,470
So, who is, you know, human here?

1294
01:34:57,500 --> 01:34:58,410
Oh, no.

1295
01:34:59,420 --> 01:35:00,860
Hello, bowling ball.

1296
01:35:00,860 --> 01:35:03,010
- It's Puck. - How did he know we'd be here?

1297
01:35:03,010 --> 01:35:05,760
Hello, princess. Did you miss me?

1298
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,950
Oh, my God.

1299
01:35:09,350 --> 01:35:10,680
What?

1300
01:35:12,460 --> 01:35:13,890
What?

1301
01:35:13,980 --> 01:35:16,100
- Puck! - Let's go.

1302
01:35:16,480 --> 01:35:18,140
The Archipelago told us you were coming.

1303
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,730
Is Mr. Hoy still alive?

1304
01:35:19,730 --> 01:35:20,870
I don't know.

1305
01:35:20,870 --> 01:35:22,480
If he is, he's on blockers.

1306
01:35:22,750 --> 01:35:24,230
Come on, let's go.

1307
01:35:25,930 --> 01:35:27,420
This vongole.

1308
01:35:28,880 --> 01:35:31,350
Not like the tourist shit across the street.

1309
01:35:40,480 --> 01:35:42,370
Andale. Let's go. Vamos.

1310
01:35:54,130 --> 01:35:55,880
Again with the hair?

1311
01:35:55,920 --> 01:35:57,860
Puck, it's creepy.

1312
01:35:57,860 --> 01:35:59,200
What?

1313
01:35:59,380 --> 01:36:01,180
I don't know what you are talking about.

1314
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:03,780
So, we've had our eyes on Facchini for years.

1315
01:36:04,050 --> 01:36:05,320
She's part of the Palugio family.

1316
01:36:05,330 --> 01:36:07,630
She spent time abroad as a gun for hire in Europe

1317
01:36:07,630 --> 01:36:09,500
and as a sniffer for BPO.

1318
01:36:09,580 --> 01:36:11,980
But she always remained close to her people here.

1319
01:36:11,980 --> 01:36:14,080
This is Alphonse. And Sutra.

1320
01:36:14,600 --> 01:36:16,430
We hunt collaborators.

1321
01:36:17,380 --> 01:36:20,060
And Lila Facchini's cluster is one of the worst.

1322
01:36:20,060 --> 01:36:22,570
We've been monitoring Ms. Facchini's network for a while.

1323
01:36:22,570 --> 01:36:23,340
Yeah, we think she may have

1324
01:36:23,340 --> 01:36:25,690
smuggled the Cannibal into the Palugio rione.

1325
01:36:25,700 --> 01:36:28,580
But our problem is where.

1326
01:36:28,700 --> 01:36:32,030
There are several palazzos from which they run their business.

1327
01:36:33,260 --> 01:36:34,740
It's that one.

1328
01:36:35,900 --> 01:36:38,070
The Forcella? How do you know that?

1329
01:36:43,860 --> 01:36:45,660
A reliable source.

1330
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:51,270
- The Forcella won't be easy. - Let's be very clear.

1331
01:36:52,070 --> 01:36:54,810
The Forcella is impossible.

1332
01:36:54,830 --> 01:36:56,150
Why is that?

1333
01:36:56,150 --> 01:36:58,350
The gate is off Via Becchino.

1334
01:36:58,360 --> 01:37:02,170
Yeah. And it's guarded. Twenty-four seven.

1335
01:37:02,170 --> 01:37:04,650
Even the polizia come by invitation only.

1336
01:37:04,910 --> 01:37:06,850
And if they don't invite you?

1337
01:37:06,850 --> 01:37:08,290
Camorra baptism.

1338
01:37:08,290 --> 01:37:09,800
That doesn't sound good.

1339
01:37:09,800 --> 01:37:12,810
A shower of bullets at point-blank range.

1340
01:37:13,090 --> 01:37:14,670
Definitely not good.

1341
01:37:23,270 --> 01:37:24,540
I'm sorry.

1342
01:37:25,280 --> 01:37:26,010
First, I have to admit

1343
01:37:26,010 --> 01:37:28,890
that the closest I've come to executing a military strategy

1344
01:37:28,890 --> 01:37:31,760
was gaining tenure at my university,

1345
01:37:31,790 --> 01:37:36,340
but it seems that what this plan needs...

1346
01:37:37,700 --> 01:37:39,910
is a Trojan horse.

1347
01:37:40,710 --> 01:37:43,220
I'm not really sure how that's going to help us, mate,

1348
01:37:43,230 --> 01:37:47,020
but... A couple of Trojans right here.

1349
01:37:48,260 --> 01:37:51,520
No. No, that wasn't quite what I had in mind.

1350
01:37:57,660 --> 01:38:00,290
It was, uh, close to this very spot

1351
01:38:00,290 --> 01:38:02,450
that the great poet Virgil

1352
01:38:02,450 --> 01:38:05,070
allegedly wrote part of his epic poem The Aeneid,

1353
01:38:05,070 --> 01:38:08,890
which depending on whether you are from Italy or Greece,

1354
01:38:08,900 --> 01:38:11,940
is a masterpiece or a knockoff.

1355
01:38:14,750 --> 01:38:18,460
Tourists. They're like fucking rats.

1356
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:23,840
Of course, you all know that Virgil wrote,

1357
01:38:23,980 --> 01:38:27,630
"Amor vincit omnia!"

1358
01:38:28,660 --> 01:38:31,140
"Love conquers all things."

1359
01:38:37,130 --> 01:38:39,090
He also wrote the descent into Hell is easy,

1360
01:38:39,090 --> 01:38:42,580
but maybe I think I'll skip that part.

1361
01:38:53,160 --> 01:38:54,440
Okay, okay...

1362
01:38:58,500 --> 01:38:59,720
Stop the bus.

1363
01:38:59,720 --> 01:39:01,130
Stop the bus.

1364
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,730
Stop it. Stop it.

1365
01:39:10,260 --> 01:39:12,100
Okay, phase one.

1366
01:39:12,100 --> 01:39:14,040
The horse is inside.

1367
01:39:14,150 --> 01:39:15,880
We have come in search of Virgil.

1368
01:39:16,580 --> 01:39:18,770
No, no, no. No, Virgil!

1369
01:39:23,830 --> 01:39:27,450
Isn't it incredible to breathe the air that Virgil once breathed?

1370
01:39:29,220 --> 01:39:31,130
Is this Italian leather?

1371
01:39:33,680 --> 01:39:36,070
A little bit close. Close. My wife.

1372
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:37,260
We're just fine.

1373
01:39:40,200 --> 01:39:42,650
We have to be careful. This is when they'll be suspicious.

1374
01:39:42,650 --> 01:39:44,010
We're watching.

1375
01:39:47,260 --> 01:39:49,310
Get back on that fucking bus!

1376
01:39:49,320 --> 01:39:51,140
Get back on that fucking bus!

1377
01:39:52,070 --> 01:39:53,830
- Now! - Go. Go, go, go, go.

1378
01:40:06,460 --> 01:40:07,940
Phase two.

1379
01:40:08,020 --> 01:40:10,390
Operation Gas And Oil.

1380
01:40:10,900 --> 01:40:13,370
Sorry. Sorry. Okay.

1381
01:40:13,370 --> 01:40:16,780
Wait, please. I'm going for the hood. For the hood.

1382
01:40:16,780 --> 01:40:18,980
Please. Please. Okay?

1383
01:40:20,690 --> 01:40:23,230
Okay, wait. Okay, it's an oil problem.

1384
01:40:25,780 --> 01:40:26,560
Okay.

1385
01:40:26,560 --> 01:40:27,730
I can--

1386
01:40:33,590 --> 01:40:35,040
You should have said that from the start!

1387
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:36,840
Just open and then...

1388
01:40:37,400 --> 01:40:38,990
Okay. Now we try.

1389
01:40:38,990 --> 01:40:42,500
Now we try, okay? No problem. Yeah.

1390
01:40:42,500 --> 01:40:44,070
Okay.

1391
01:40:44,220 --> 01:40:46,080
I have a good feeling about it this time.

1392
01:40:46,880 --> 01:40:48,590
Okay, let me turn the key.

1393
01:40:48,660 --> 01:40:50,950
Okay.

1394
01:40:56,300 --> 01:40:57,610
Okay.

1395
01:40:58,550 --> 01:40:59,770
Everyone off the bus!

1396
01:40:59,960 --> 01:41:02,040
Off the bus!

1397
01:41:43,550 --> 01:41:44,760
They're here.

1398
01:41:44,760 --> 01:41:46,390
Keep them away from Milton.

1399
01:41:46,390 --> 01:41:48,000
I'm on my way.

1400
01:41:54,430 --> 01:41:55,320
We're coming out!

1401
01:41:55,320 --> 01:41:56,430
Ready.

1402
01:41:56,430 --> 01:41:58,820
- Phase three. - Extraction!

1403
01:42:31,040 --> 01:42:34,790
- Just keep thinking... Eiffel Tower! - Eiffel Tower!

1404
01:42:41,220 --> 01:42:42,890
You know anything about guns?

1405
01:42:42,890 --> 01:42:44,500
I don't, but you do.

1406
01:42:53,090 --> 01:42:54,530
Let's go!

1407
01:43:06,060 --> 01:43:07,430
Let's go!

1408
01:43:40,260 --> 01:43:42,880
I could do this every day with you, Ms. Bak.

1409
01:43:44,690 --> 01:43:46,080
Hurry up!

1410
01:43:46,350 --> 01:43:48,050
This staircase leads to the top floor.

1411
01:43:48,050 --> 01:43:49,360
Got it.

1412
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,630
Was that Nomi? What's happening?

1413
01:43:51,630 --> 01:43:52,830
Didn't you listen?

1414
01:43:52,830 --> 01:43:54,600
We don't know where exactly they're holding Whispers.

1415
01:43:54,600 --> 01:43:57,050
- We're all covering different sections. - Yeah, but what if--

1416
01:44:04,330 --> 01:44:05,820
My wife...

1417
01:44:08,830 --> 01:44:10,410
You're a killer!

1418
01:44:13,180 --> 01:44:14,680
I'm sorry.

1419
01:44:24,540 --> 01:44:26,060
Can you teach me?

1420
01:44:27,820 --> 01:44:30,040
Okay, first, this isn't a real gun.

1421
01:44:30,040 --> 01:44:31,570
It's a Taser.

1422
01:44:32,380 --> 01:44:33,560
- This is a gun. - All right.

1423
01:44:33,570 --> 01:44:35,050
- Here's the safety. - All right.

1424
01:44:35,050 --> 01:44:37,880
Do not point unless you're sure about the target, okay?

1425
01:45:31,060 --> 01:45:32,900
Oh, shit this is serious!

1426
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:44,050
You all right?

1427
01:45:44,870 --> 01:45:46,990
Goddamn it, Gorski.

1428
01:45:47,130 --> 01:45:49,520
You know I should be in fucking Pensacola, right?

1429
01:45:49,520 --> 01:45:51,120
Come on, let's go!

1430
01:45:55,570 --> 01:45:57,130
Not again!

1431
01:46:00,670 --> 01:46:02,350
Come! Come! Come! Come!

1432
01:46:07,270 --> 01:46:08,750
Will you get him to Bug?

1433
01:46:09,830 --> 01:46:11,060
I'll go this way.

1434
01:46:11,060 --> 01:46:12,440
All right.

1435
01:46:12,440 --> 01:46:13,800
Come. Come.

1436
01:46:14,140 --> 01:46:16,700
Why do I always have to get shot?

1437
01:46:17,430 --> 01:46:18,760
Sorry, man.

1438
01:46:50,160 --> 01:46:51,430
What?

1439
01:46:56,030 --> 01:46:57,500
Joong-Ki.

1440
01:46:58,150 --> 01:47:00,620
Just when I was starting to forget about him.

1441
01:47:22,130 --> 01:47:24,010
Lila's entering the palazzo.

1442
01:47:24,010 --> 01:47:26,300
Goddamn it. We need to clear this floor.

1443
01:47:28,370 --> 01:47:29,820
He's got to be upstairs.

1444
01:47:29,820 --> 01:47:31,180
Okay.

1445
01:47:50,700 --> 01:47:52,420
He's secure.

1446
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:54,770
Good.

1447
01:48:04,900 --> 01:48:06,210
It's her.

1448
01:48:06,210 --> 01:48:09,120
Listen. Shh. Go around.

1449
01:48:09,700 --> 01:48:11,140
Okay.

1450
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:48,020
Time to go, Milton.

1451
01:49:31,620 --> 01:49:33,100
What the fuck?

1452
01:49:42,140 --> 01:49:46,200
Ms. Bak, what is it? Look at me. Tell me.

1453
01:51:03,370 --> 01:51:04,830
Kala.

1454
01:51:11,330 --> 01:51:12,980
Kala, I love you.

1455
01:51:27,210 --> 01:51:28,730
Please.

1456
01:52:11,290 --> 01:52:12,710
Kala.

1457
01:52:13,140 --> 01:52:14,500
Kala.

1458
01:52:19,030 --> 01:52:21,880
Kala! Kala.

1459
01:52:21,880 --> 01:52:24,000
My love. My love.

1460
01:52:25,780 --> 01:52:28,630
Well, is anyone gonna actually do anything?

1461
01:52:28,630 --> 01:52:31,530
Or are you going to just let me die in your arms?

1462
01:52:31,540 --> 01:52:33,090
You're alive.

1463
01:52:33,690 --> 01:52:34,780
- She's alive? - She's alive!

1464
01:52:34,780 --> 01:52:37,450
But I won't be if you don't do something quickly.

1465
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:39,150
What do I do?

1466
01:52:39,160 --> 01:52:40,380
Save my life.

1467
01:52:40,380 --> 01:52:43,300
First, lay me down and stop the bleeding.

1468
01:52:46,030 --> 01:52:47,470
Oh, my love!

1469
01:52:51,290 --> 01:52:53,070
- Press it. Press that on her wound. - Oh, God.

1470
01:52:53,070 --> 01:52:54,250
Press it hard.

1471
01:52:54,760 --> 01:52:56,370
- Harder! I'm not that fragile. - Harder!

1472
01:52:56,370 --> 01:52:57,810
Harder.

1473
01:52:57,930 --> 01:53:00,770
I don't seem to have ruptured any major artery.

1474
01:53:01,040 --> 01:53:02,130
But I've lost blood.

1475
01:53:02,130 --> 01:53:04,050
She doesn't think a major artery is ruptured.

1476
01:53:04,050 --> 01:53:05,090
What now?

1477
01:53:05,090 --> 01:53:07,120
Compression to keep my blood circulating.

1478
01:53:07,120 --> 01:53:09,700
We should keep her blood moving. All right. Okay.

1479
01:53:09,720 --> 01:53:11,860
And oxygen to protect my brain.

1480
01:53:11,860 --> 01:53:13,520
She needs oxygen.

1481
01:53:18,570 --> 01:53:21,220
Her heart, it's not beating! It's not beating.

1482
01:53:22,320 --> 01:53:23,720
Kala.

1483
01:53:26,930 --> 01:53:28,490
I hear you.

1484
01:53:28,530 --> 01:53:31,430
Don't leave me. Stay with me.

1485
01:53:31,440 --> 01:53:34,090
Please! Don't stop.

1486
01:53:35,470 --> 01:53:36,750
Stay with me.

1487
01:53:38,550 --> 01:53:40,910
You said I couldn't give up.

1488
01:53:41,060 --> 01:53:42,680
You can't either.

1489
01:53:46,440 --> 01:53:47,990
Stay with me.

1490
01:53:48,030 --> 01:53:50,220
Wolfgang! How about this?

1491
01:53:52,490 --> 01:53:53,930
All right.

1492
01:53:58,120 --> 01:54:00,400
My wife. Kala.

1493
01:54:00,400 --> 01:54:02,220
Oh, God. Oh, God.

1494
01:54:15,870 --> 01:54:19,430
To think, I might never have kissed these lips again.

1495
01:54:24,150 --> 01:54:26,650
- My husband. - My wife.

1496
01:54:29,890 --> 01:54:31,530
You're a genius.

1497
01:54:34,300 --> 01:54:36,840
My love, now what do we do?

1498
01:54:37,130 --> 01:54:38,010
- Take her to the hospital! - Yeah. Yeah.

1499
01:54:38,020 --> 01:54:41,080
No, no. We have to get Lila.

1500
01:54:41,080 --> 01:54:42,130
Lila's gone.

1501
01:54:42,130 --> 01:54:44,210
We don't know where she's gonna meet the Chairman.

1502
01:54:44,210 --> 01:54:45,870
It could be anywhere.

1503
01:54:46,790 --> 01:54:48,220
Or it could be at a heliport

1504
01:54:48,220 --> 01:54:50,070
where they just cleared a BPO helicopter

1505
01:54:50,070 --> 01:54:51,930
for an emergency landing.

1506
01:54:54,610 --> 01:54:56,040
I got him.

1507
01:54:56,040 --> 01:54:57,520
You go.

1508
01:55:32,810 --> 01:55:34,390
The helicopter is on approach.

1509
01:55:34,390 --> 01:55:35,730
Shit.

1510
01:55:41,350 --> 01:55:44,670
Hang on, hang on. There's major military support.

1511
01:55:56,670 --> 01:55:58,420
Please, Jonas! Not now!

1512
01:55:58,420 --> 01:56:00,340
Unintentional, believe me.

1513
01:56:01,050 --> 01:56:03,270
But I promise this will be the last time.

1514
01:56:06,390 --> 01:56:10,920
"We are healed of suffering only by experiencing it to the full."

1515
01:56:12,190 --> 01:56:14,890
I wonder if Monsieur Proust was ever shot.

1516
01:56:15,110 --> 01:56:16,480
What happened?

1517
01:56:23,680 --> 01:56:25,940
Jonas, what are you doing?

1518
01:56:26,290 --> 01:56:27,970
Keeping my word.

1519
01:56:49,700 --> 01:56:51,200
Promise me.

1520
01:56:51,810 --> 01:56:54,470
You have to promise me.

1521
01:57:05,370 --> 01:57:07,700
So here we are. The end.

1522
01:57:07,700 --> 01:57:10,100
No more secrets, no more lies.

1523
01:57:10,690 --> 01:57:12,410
After Raoul was killed,

1524
01:57:12,450 --> 01:57:14,790
we learned Milton was going to meet with the Chairman

1525
01:57:15,050 --> 01:57:17,870
to demonstrate the viability of the drone program.

1526
01:57:22,620 --> 01:57:24,390
Angelica had a plan.

1527
01:57:26,430 --> 01:57:29,290
She smuggled two of our cluster into the facility.

1528
01:57:31,050 --> 01:57:32,990
Secrecy was essential.

1529
01:57:43,740 --> 01:57:47,510
But Harry... Poor Harry.

1530
01:57:50,060 --> 01:57:52,070
This isn't how we planned it.

1531
01:57:54,310 --> 01:57:56,130
I'm not you, Angelica.

1532
01:57:58,770 --> 01:58:00,330
I know.

1533
01:58:05,240 --> 01:58:06,660
It wasn't my idea.

1534
01:58:06,660 --> 01:58:08,580
You have to warn everybody.

1535
01:58:08,580 --> 01:58:10,380
Harry, what's going on?

1536
01:58:33,610 --> 01:58:35,570
Halt! Stop!

1537
01:59:13,030 --> 01:59:15,880
Angelica. It was her.

1538
01:59:16,410 --> 01:59:18,540
She tried to kill the Chairman.

1539
01:59:30,880 --> 01:59:33,420
This is the secret I couldn't talk about.

1540
01:59:33,710 --> 01:59:35,310
The psycranium.

1541
01:59:38,820 --> 01:59:42,420
Angelica tuned it to the psychic ligature of Whisper's brain.

1542
01:59:43,210 --> 01:59:47,310
He believed he alone had the power to control the drones.

1543
01:59:49,200 --> 01:59:50,750
He was wrong.

1544
01:59:55,950 --> 02:00:00,190
This was her prototype. We kept it as insurance.

1545
02:00:01,570 --> 02:00:02,990
Our secret.

1546
02:00:08,670 --> 02:00:11,710
I respect what you have done, Ms. Facchini,

1547
02:00:11,720 --> 02:00:14,880
but if you betray me again, I will destroy you.

1548
02:00:18,570 --> 02:00:20,520
I'm already on blockers, thank you.

1549
02:00:20,530 --> 02:00:23,170
And you have lied to me before.

1550
02:00:35,400 --> 02:00:36,950
All right, Ms. Facchini.

1551
02:00:36,950 --> 02:00:40,610
Give me Dr. Brandt and you can have your rione.

1552
02:00:40,610 --> 02:00:41,820
First I need the one thing

1553
02:00:41,820 --> 02:00:44,470
I know will ensure your ongoing cooperation.

1554
02:00:44,880 --> 02:00:47,030
My identity.

1555
02:00:47,210 --> 02:00:49,010
As we agreed, Mr. Chairman.

1556
02:01:00,210 --> 02:01:03,120
Oh, yes.

1557
02:01:05,560 --> 02:01:08,110
Your kind did this to me.

1558
02:01:08,110 --> 02:01:09,520
And one day--

1559
02:01:23,680 --> 02:01:25,590
Jonas, what just happened?

1560
02:01:29,670 --> 02:01:30,700
My love.

1561
02:01:30,860 --> 02:01:32,140
You did it.

1562
02:01:39,030 --> 02:01:40,630
I will always...

1563
02:01:40,630 --> 02:01:42,260
Be here.

1564
02:01:47,440 --> 02:01:48,350
Goodbye, Will.

1565
02:01:48,350 --> 02:01:49,310
Jonas.

1566
02:01:58,010 --> 02:01:59,100
Jonas!

1567
02:01:59,490 --> 02:02:00,400
Fuck!

1568
02:02:00,870 --> 02:02:02,090
What just happened?

1569
02:02:02,310 --> 02:02:04,700
I don't know, but I have a request from the pilot.

1570
02:02:04,700 --> 02:02:05,390
Shit!

1571
02:02:05,390 --> 02:02:06,880
We can scramble the air traffic clearance,

1572
02:02:06,880 --> 02:02:08,950
but it will only give us a minute.

1573
02:02:09,720 --> 02:02:10,960
That's all we need.

1574
02:03:02,700 --> 02:03:03,750
Come on, Milton.

1575
02:03:03,820 --> 02:03:06,040
Or do you want me to leave you for Officer Gorski?

1576
02:03:18,740 --> 02:03:19,850
Shit!

1577
02:03:20,220 --> 02:03:21,390
They're getting away.

1578
02:03:21,640 --> 02:03:22,930
Like hell they are.

1579
02:04:16,620 --> 02:04:19,660
Mr. Hoy. You're alive!

1580
02:04:19,870 --> 02:04:21,710
Barely, Ms. Blue.

1581
02:04:21,820 --> 02:04:23,720
I was just explaining to River

1582
02:04:23,730 --> 02:04:27,580
how Mrs. Stromness thundered through that room

1583
02:04:27,580 --> 02:04:33,020
laying waste to all those BPO platoons.

1584
02:04:33,020 --> 02:04:34,340
Aunt Kirsty?

1585
02:04:34,340 --> 02:04:35,730
Aye, Ms. Blue.

1586
02:04:36,370 --> 02:04:37,910
If it was a film...

1587
02:04:38,530 --> 02:04:40,000
I wouldn't have believed it.

1588
02:04:42,420 --> 02:04:44,630
So, how's your gunshot?

1589
02:04:44,630 --> 02:04:47,270
Oh, I'm feeling much better. Thank you.

1590
02:04:47,680 --> 02:04:49,740
We actually have a really good doctor in Italy.

1591
02:04:49,740 --> 02:04:52,980
Yeah. He's practically family.

1592
02:04:54,470 --> 02:04:56,670
- Buongiorno, my friends. - Ah, Dottore.

1593
02:04:56,670 --> 02:04:57,930
So, you're back again,

1594
02:04:57,930 --> 02:05:00,700
but this time you did not dodge the bullet.

1595
02:05:07,370 --> 02:05:09,070
So, have you talked with Rajan,

1596
02:05:09,530 --> 02:05:11,630
you know, about the future?

1597
02:05:12,450 --> 02:05:13,320
No.

1598
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:16,290
Do you think it will work out?

1599
02:05:18,370 --> 02:05:19,400
I don't know.

1600
02:05:27,690 --> 02:05:29,940
Are you kidding me?

1601
02:05:30,360 --> 02:05:31,970
Are you kidding me?

1602
02:05:42,680 --> 02:05:43,980
So the hearing went well?

1603
02:05:44,220 --> 02:05:47,080
Yeah, the court exonerated her of all charges.

1604
02:05:47,080 --> 02:05:47,670
That's great.

1605
02:05:47,670 --> 02:05:48,960
We would've been back sooner,

1606
02:05:48,970 --> 02:05:51,580
but she wanted to introduce her family to me.

1607
02:05:51,580 --> 02:05:54,640
Shit. That's serious. How'd that go?

1608
02:06:04,530 --> 02:06:05,420
Pretty good.

1609
02:06:05,750 --> 02:06:07,640
Well. Look at you.

1610
02:06:10,630 --> 02:06:13,710
Oh, my God. Leave it to Michael...

1611
02:06:13,720 --> 02:06:16,000
Mom, I am warning you.

1612
02:06:16,050 --> 02:06:18,790
Leave it to Nomi to turn what should be

1613
02:06:18,790 --> 02:06:24,910
a simple civil service into a spectacle.

1614
02:06:24,910 --> 02:06:26,490
I think it's awesome!

1615
02:06:26,820 --> 02:06:28,280
It's crazy I know, but

1616
02:06:28,300 --> 02:06:30,400
that woman over there is a special minister

1617
02:06:30,400 --> 02:06:33,680
in the French government and she made all of this happen.

1618
02:06:34,900 --> 02:06:36,210
Oh, come, come, come.

1619
02:06:40,640 --> 02:06:42,670
This is her.

1620
02:06:43,650 --> 02:06:46,060
The spirit of Jean-Claude.

1621
02:06:50,410 --> 02:06:52,350
Spirit of Jean-Claude.

1622
02:06:54,610 --> 02:06:55,460
Dad.

1623
02:06:56,070 --> 02:06:56,940
Sven.

1624
02:06:57,650 --> 02:06:58,640
This is Will.

1625
02:07:01,190 --> 02:07:02,530
- Come here, man. - Okay.

1626
02:07:03,510 --> 02:07:04,690
I'm blessed.

1627
02:07:05,350 --> 02:07:06,910
I know what you did for my daughter.

1628
02:07:06,910 --> 02:07:08,970
I'll never be able to thank you enough.

1629
02:07:08,970 --> 02:07:11,870
Sir, the day I met your daughter...

1630
02:07:13,120 --> 02:07:15,050
was the best day of my life.

1631
02:07:19,880 --> 02:07:21,720
You must be Janet.

1632
02:07:22,000 --> 02:07:23,210
I am.

1633
02:07:23,210 --> 02:07:26,290
I'm-- I'm Grace. I'm Amanita's mother.

1634
02:07:27,490 --> 02:07:29,890
And we're her dads.

1635
02:07:30,240 --> 02:07:31,220
I'm Tom.

1636
02:07:31,370 --> 02:07:33,850
We all just love Nomi so much.

1637
02:07:33,850 --> 02:07:35,730
What an extraordinary woman.

1638
02:07:35,730 --> 02:07:37,870
You must be very proud of her.

1639
02:07:39,540 --> 02:07:40,470
We are.

1640
02:07:40,560 --> 02:07:43,000
We were just talking about when they first met.

1641
02:07:43,010 --> 02:07:45,130
Such a great story.

1642
02:07:45,840 --> 02:07:47,820
I don't think we know it.

1643
02:07:47,820 --> 02:07:50,440
Well, Amanita used to go through girlfriends

1644
02:07:50,450 --> 02:07:53,100
the way people binge TV shows.

1645
02:07:53,200 --> 02:07:55,570
When Nomi went to City Lights...

1646
02:07:55,570 --> 02:07:57,820
She was looking for this obscure book...

1647
02:07:57,820 --> 02:07:59,510
And when she found Amanita...

1648
02:07:59,510 --> 02:08:02,020
When she was shelving returns.

1649
02:08:02,020 --> 02:08:03,130
And the book that Nomi was

1650
02:08:03,140 --> 02:08:06,060
looking for was right there in Amanita's hand.

1651
02:08:06,060 --> 02:08:07,500
Which is just about the

1652
02:08:07,500 --> 02:08:10,690
best description of love we've ever heard.

1653
02:08:25,360 --> 02:08:27,600
- That's normal, honey. - Okay.

1654
02:08:41,740 --> 02:08:42,830
Thank you.

1655
02:09:13,230 --> 02:09:16,290
You are so beautiful.

1656
02:09:16,340 --> 02:09:17,820
Thanks, Bug.

1657
02:09:18,260 --> 02:09:22,360
No, thank you for being my family.

1658
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:24,910
Thank you for being mine.

1659
02:09:38,710 --> 02:09:40,330
You look amazing.

1660
02:09:40,400 --> 02:09:41,630
So do you.

1661
02:09:42,100 --> 02:09:43,150
Thank you.

1662
02:09:53,700 --> 02:09:56,570
The improbable unfolding of recent events

1663
02:09:56,570 --> 02:09:58,420
have led me to consider

1664
02:09:58,420 --> 02:10:01,980
that no one thing is one thing only.

1665
02:10:01,980 --> 02:10:05,220
How people endow what is familiar with

1666
02:10:05,230 --> 02:10:09,930
new, ever-evolving meaning and by doing so,

1667
02:10:10,420 --> 02:10:14,840
release us from the expected, the familiar

1668
02:10:14,890 --> 02:10:17,540
into something unforeseeable.

1669
02:10:18,280 --> 02:10:21,000
It is in this unfamiliar realm,

1670
02:10:21,450 --> 02:10:23,670
we find new possibilities.

1671
02:10:24,520 --> 02:10:27,180
It is in the unknown, we find hope.

1672
02:10:27,710 --> 02:10:29,890
Here we stand in the Eiffel Tower,

1673
02:10:29,890 --> 02:10:34,770
which was conceived in gratitude for the French Revolution.

1674
02:10:34,770 --> 02:10:38,950
It has been a zeppelin lookout, a transmitter tower,

1675
02:10:39,620 --> 02:10:42,000
and, for generations of Parisians,

1676
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:46,820
an aspiration for a better, a brighter future.

1677
02:10:47,180 --> 02:10:50,380
Similarly plural in meaning is a wedding.

1678
02:10:50,910 --> 02:10:52,550
A wedding is a celebration

1679
02:10:52,550 --> 02:10:54,740
which can also be understood

1680
02:10:54,740 --> 02:10:57,900
as a union of two families...

1681
02:10:58,140 --> 02:10:59,420
and in this case,

1682
02:10:59,420 --> 02:11:03,090
this union takes on an even deeper significance.

1683
02:11:04,290 --> 02:11:08,310
And for me, this wedding is proof.

1684
02:11:13,180 --> 02:11:17,110
Proof that for all the differences between us

1685
02:11:17,170 --> 02:11:20,800
and all the forces that try to divide us...

1686
02:11:22,980 --> 02:11:27,150
they will never exceed the power of love to unite us.

1687
02:11:33,930 --> 02:11:35,420
Oh, God.

1688
02:11:42,150 --> 02:11:43,250
My love...

1689
02:11:46,830 --> 02:11:50,380
We live in a world that distrusts feelings.

1690
02:11:51,430 --> 02:11:53,690
Over and over, we are reminded that feelings

1691
02:11:53,700 --> 02:11:56,060
are not as important as reason.

1692
02:11:56,210 --> 02:11:59,140
That feelings are childish,

1693
02:11:59,320 --> 02:12:02,650
irresponsible, dangerous.

1694
02:12:03,970 --> 02:12:08,930
We are taught to ignore them, control, or deny them.

1695
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:12,810
We barely understand what they are, where they come from,

1696
02:12:12,810 --> 02:12:14,460
or how they seem to understand us

1697
02:12:14,460 --> 02:12:16,930
better than we understand ourselves.

1698
02:12:18,540 --> 02:12:21,110
But I know that feelings matter.

1699
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:23,980
Sometimes, they're little...

1700
02:12:24,750 --> 02:12:28,920
like when I smell cinnamon toast and I miss my grandma.

1701
02:12:30,180 --> 02:12:33,070
And sometimes, they are huge...

1702
02:12:34,050 --> 02:12:36,860
like when I found out my girlfriend shares her thoughts

1703
02:12:36,860 --> 02:12:40,060
with seven other people around the world.

1704
02:12:43,270 --> 02:12:45,130
However, if you're lucky...

1705
02:12:45,780 --> 02:12:48,200
I mean, really lucky...

1706
02:12:49,230 --> 02:12:52,760
a feeling comes along that will change everything.

1707
02:12:55,890 --> 02:12:59,110
I remember such a feeling and how it walloped me years ago

1708
02:12:59,110 --> 02:13:01,990
when this girl walked into my bookstore.

1709
02:13:03,790 --> 02:13:06,860
It is the same feeling that I have right now.

1710
02:13:08,430 --> 02:13:10,720
The feeling that this is her.

1711
02:13:11,980 --> 02:13:13,260
My love.

1712
02:13:15,930 --> 02:13:17,330
My wife.

1713
02:13:20,270 --> 02:13:22,470
This is my future.

1714
02:13:25,490 --> 02:13:26,730
And I trust this feeling

1715
02:13:26,730 --> 02:13:30,230
more than I have trusted anything in my life.

1716
02:13:36,050 --> 02:13:37,370
Thank you.

1717
02:13:47,900 --> 02:13:49,260
Amanita...

1718
02:13:53,320 --> 02:13:56,290
I wrote this thing like a hundred times

1719
02:13:56,290 --> 02:13:58,250
and I tore them all up

1720
02:13:58,750 --> 02:14:02,700
because I have to admit, I don't like vows.

1721
02:14:03,860 --> 02:14:05,520
I'm afraid of things pretending

1722
02:14:05,520 --> 02:14:09,810
to be permanent because nothing is permanent.

1723
02:14:10,560 --> 02:14:13,830
My life, especially these past two years,

1724
02:14:13,830 --> 02:14:17,880
is a testament to the fact that things change,

1725
02:14:18,090 --> 02:14:20,500
people change.

1726
02:14:23,210 --> 02:14:24,570
But with you...

1727
02:14:25,610 --> 02:14:27,440
that doesn't scare me.

1728
02:14:28,900 --> 02:14:31,070
It actually makes me happy.

1729
02:14:32,190 --> 02:14:33,870
It makes me excited...

1730
02:14:35,010 --> 02:14:38,900
because I can think of no better life

1731
02:14:39,040 --> 02:14:42,310
than watching Amanita Caplan change...

1732
02:14:43,400 --> 02:14:47,250
watching her evolve and grow.

1733
02:14:48,950 --> 02:14:52,640
I want to see everything that you become.

1734
02:14:54,330 --> 02:14:57,160
I want to know what your hair looks like in a year

1735
02:14:57,160 --> 02:14:58,910
and decades from now.

1736
02:15:00,660 --> 02:15:04,780
I may not be a tragically detached French girl,

1737
02:15:04,830 --> 02:15:08,730
but I want to live in an attic apartment in Paris

1738
02:15:08,910 --> 02:15:11,610
and bring you tea as you write your novel.

1739
02:15:13,120 --> 02:15:17,010
And when we're both wrinkled old ladies,

1740
02:15:17,350 --> 02:15:19,820
with cellulite covering my ass,

1741
02:15:20,060 --> 02:15:22,330
bunions all over your feet,

1742
02:15:22,580 --> 02:15:24,970
both of us hogging the blankets...

1743
02:15:26,030 --> 02:15:30,870
I know I will still remember this moment.

1744
02:15:31,680 --> 02:15:35,710
I will still be wearing this ring.

1745
02:15:37,870 --> 02:15:40,080
Because inside your arms

1746
02:15:40,480 --> 02:15:42,400
is the only place

1747
02:15:42,540 --> 02:15:46,260
I've ever felt like I was home.

1748
02:16:03,610 --> 02:16:06,680
Well, then, by the power invested in me,

1749
02:16:06,680 --> 02:16:10,070
I pronounce you wife and wife.

1750
02:16:28,880 --> 02:16:30,960
A gift from Paris and the new BPO

1751
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:34,250
in honor of the accord and this celebration.

1752
02:16:34,450 --> 02:16:35,530
Thank you.

1753
02:18:31,820 --> 02:18:34,300
I always cry at weddings.

1754
02:18:34,910 --> 02:18:36,170
Me too.

1755
02:18:58,960 --> 02:18:59,970
Try one.

1756
02:19:00,000 --> 02:19:02,520
You'll never be the same again.

1757
02:19:22,170 --> 02:19:23,710
Have you talked to either of them?

1758
02:19:24,490 --> 02:19:25,820
No.

1759
02:19:29,650 --> 02:19:31,230
Do you know what you want?

1760
02:20:09,070 --> 02:20:10,070
Nomi!

1761
02:20:11,110 --> 02:20:12,760
Nomi!

1762
02:20:13,010 --> 02:20:14,550
Nomi!

1763
02:20:14,550 --> 02:20:16,660
I don't know what I was thinking.

1764
02:20:18,030 --> 02:20:19,100
Nomi...

1765
02:20:20,010 --> 02:20:22,200
It's a beautiful name.

1766
02:20:33,850 --> 02:20:38,280
Lawrence, why didn't we come to Paris until now?

1767
02:20:45,430 --> 02:20:46,770
What just happened?

1768
02:20:46,890 --> 02:20:48,010
I don't know.

1769
02:21:17,220 --> 02:21:18,640
As a wedding present,

1770
02:21:18,900 --> 02:21:22,220
we want to send you wherever you wish to go for your honeymoon.

1771
02:21:22,600 --> 02:21:23,770
We insist.

1772
02:21:24,660 --> 02:21:26,790
That is so sweet.

1773
02:21:28,100 --> 02:21:28,780
But--

1774
02:21:28,780 --> 02:21:31,610
There's only one place that we want to go.

1775
02:26:17,360 --> 02:26:18,950
My God.

1776
02:26:21,260 --> 02:26:23,930
I didn't think such things were possible.

1778
02:27:10,970 --> 02:27:14,870
{\an9}* We're a thousand miles from comfort *

1779
02:27:14,870 --> 02:27:18,160
{\an9} * We have traveled land and sea *

1780
02:27:18,800 --> 02:27:22,690
{\an9}* But as long as you are with me *

1781
02:27:23,080 --> 02:27:26,160
{\an9}* There's no place I'd rather be *

1782
02:27:27,330 --> 02:27:30,510
{\an9}* I would wait forever *

1783
02:27:31,060 --> 02:27:34,110
{\an9}* Exalted in the scene *

1784
02:27:34,950 --> 02:27:38,330
{\an9}* As long as I am with you *

1785
02:27:39,250 --> 02:27:42,250
{\an9}* My heart continues to beat *

1786
02:27:43,390 --> 02:27:45,360
{\an9}* With every step we take *

1787
02:27:45,360 --> 02:27:47,140
{\an9}* Kyoto to the Bay *

1788
02:27:47,140 --> 02:27:49,960
{\an9}* Strolling so casually *

1789
02:27:51,330 --> 02:27:55,060
{\an9}* We're different and the same Gave you another name *

1790
02:27:55,060 --> 02:27:58,360
{\an9}* Switch up the batteries *

1791
02:27:59,090 --> 02:28:03,090
{\an9}* If you gave me a chance I would take it *

1792
02:28:03,090 --> 02:28:07,010
{\an9}* It's a shot in the dark But I'll make it *

1793
02:28:07,010 --> 02:28:10,950
{\an9}* Know with all of your heart You can't shame me *

1794
02:28:10,950 --> 02:28:15,230
{\an9}* When I am with you There's no place I'd rather be *

1795
02:28:15,230 --> 02:28:17,080
{\an9}* No, no, no, no, no *

1796

{\an9}* No place I'd rather be *

1801
02:28:30,500 --> 02:28:34,150
{\an9}* We staked out on a mission *

1802
02:28:34,470 --> 02:28:38,270
{\an9}* To find our inner peace *

1803
02:28:38,680 --> 02:28:42,060
{\an9}* Make it everlasting *

1804
02:28:42,370 --> 02:28:45,570
{\an9}* So nothing's incomplete *

1805
02:28:46,350 --> 02:28:49,880
{\an9}* It's easy being with you *

1806
02:28:50,360 --> 02:28:53,860
{\an9}* Sacred simplicity *

1807
02:28:54,350 --> 02:28:57,800
{\an9}* As long as we're together *
