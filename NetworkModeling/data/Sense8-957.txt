The improbable unfolding of recent events have led me to consider that no one thing is one thing only. How people endow what is familiar with new, ever-evolving meaning and by doing so, release us from the expected, the familiar into something unforeseeable. It is in this unfamiliar realm, we find new possibilities. It is in the unknown, we find hope. Here we stand in the Eiffel Tower, which was conceived in gratitude for the French Revolution. It has been a zeppelin lookout, a transmitter tower, and, for generations of Parisians, an aspiration for a better, a brighter future. Similarly plural in meaning is a wedding. A wedding is a celebration which can also be understood as a union of two families... and in this case, this union takes on an even deeper significance. And for me, this wedding is proof. Proof that for all the differences between us and all the forces that try to divide us... they will never exceed the power of love to unite us.
